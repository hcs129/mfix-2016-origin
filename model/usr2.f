!  Module name: USR2                                                   C
!  Purpose: This routine is called from the outer iteration loop and   C
!           is user-definable.  The user may insert code in this       C
!           routine or call appropriate user defined subroutines. This C
!           can be used for updating quantities every iteration.  Use  C
!           this routine sparingly considering the large computational C
!           over head. This routine is not called from an              C
!           IJK loop, hence all indices are undefined.                 C               C
