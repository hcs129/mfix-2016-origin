C
C *Arguments:
C     F     :EXT    Name of subroutine for right-hand-side vector f.
C                   This name must be declared EXTERNAL in calling
C                   program.  The form of F must be:
C
C                   SUBROUTINE  F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
C                   INTEGER  NEQ
C                   DOUBLE PRECISION  T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
C
C                   The inputs are NEQ, T, Y.  F is to set
C
C                   YDOT(i) = f(i,T,Y(1),Y(2),...,Y(NEQ)),
C                                                     i = 1, ..., NEQ .
C
C     NEQ   :IN     Number of first-order ODE's.
C
C     Y     :INOUT  Array of values of the y(t) vector, of length NEQ.
C                   Input:  For the first call, Y should contain the
C                           values of y(t) at t = T. (Y is an input
C                           variable only if ISTATE = 1.)
C                   Output: On return, Y will contain the values at the
C                           new t-value.
C
C     T     :INOUT  Value of the independent variable.  On return it
C                   will be the current value of t (normally TOUT).
C
C     TOUT  :IN     Next point where output is desired (.NE. T).
C
C     ITOL  :IN     1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or
C                   an array.
C
C     RTOL  :IN     Relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
C
C     ATOL  :IN     Absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
C                   If ITOL = 1, ATOL need not be dimensioned.
C                   If ITOL = 2, ATOL must be dimensioned at least NEQ.
C
C                   The estimated local error in Y(i) will be controlled
C                   so as to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
C
C                   EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
C                   EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
C
C                   Thus the local error test passes if, in each
C                   component, either the absolute error is less than
C                   ATOL (or ATOL(i)), or the relative error is less
C                   than RTOL.
C
C                   Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
C                   use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative
C                   error control.  Caution:  Actual (global) errors may
C                   exceed these local tolerances, so choose them
C                   conservatively.
C
C     ITASK :IN     Flag indicating the task DLSODE is to perform.
C                   Use ITASK = 1 for normal computation of output
C                   values of y at t = TOUT.
C
C     ISTATE:INOUT  Index used for input and output to specify the state
C                   of the calculation.
C                   Input:
C                    1   This is the first call for a problem.
C                    2   This is a subsequent call.
C                   Output:
C                    1   Nothing was done, because TOUT was equal to T.
C                    2   DLSODE was successful (otherwise, negative).
C                        Note that ISTATE need not be modified after a
C                        successful return.
C                   -1   Excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong
C                        MF).
C                   -2   Excess accuracy requested (tolerances too
C                        small).
C                   -3   Illegal input detected (see printed message).
C                   -4   Repeated error test failures (check all
C                        inputs).
C                   -5   Repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad
C                        Jacobian supplied or wrong choice of MF or
C                        tolerances).
C                   -6   Error weight became zero during problem
C                        (solution component i vanished, and ATOL or
C                        ATOL(i) = 0.).
C
C     IOPT  :IN     Flag indicating whether optional inputs are used:
C                   0   No.
C                   1   Yes.  (See "Optional inputs" under "Long
C                       Description," Part 1.)
C
C     RWORK :WORK   Real work array of length at least:

C
C *Description:
C     DLSODE solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
C     systems of first-order ODE's,
C
C        dy/dt = f(t,y) ,
C
C     or, in component form,
C
C        dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ))
C                                                  (i = 1, ..., NEQ) .
C
C     DLSODE is a package based on the GEAR and GEARB packages, and on
C     the October 23, 1978, version of the tentative ODEPACK user
C     interface standard, with minor modifications.
C
C     The steps in solving such a problem are as follows.
C
C     a. First write a subroutine of the form
C
C           SUBROUTINE  F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
C           INTEGER  NEQ
C           DOUBLE PRECISION  T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
C
C        which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with
C        f(i).
C
C     b. Next determine (or guess) whether or not the problem is stiff.
C        Stiffness occurs when the Jacobian matrix df/dy has an
C        eigenvalue whose real part is negative and large in magnitude
C        compared to the reciprocal of the t span of interest.  If the
C        problem is nonstiff, use method flag MF = 10.  If it is stiff,
C        there are four standard choices for MF, and DLSODE requires the
C        Jacobian matrix in some form.  This matrix is regarded either
C        as full (MF = 21 or 22), or banded (MF = 24 or 25).  In the
C        banded case, DLSODE requires two half-bandwidth parameters ML
C        and MU. These are, respectively, the widths of the lower and
C        upper parts of the band, excluding the main diagonal.  Thus the
C        band consists of the locations (i,j) with
C
C           i - ML <= j <= i + MU ,
C
C        and the full bandwidth is ML + MU + 1 .
C
C     c. If the problem is stiff, you are encouraged to supply the
C        Jacobian directly (MF = 21 or 24), but if this is not feasible,
C        DLSODE will compute it internally by difference quotients (MF =
C        22 or 25).  If you are supplying the Jacobian, write a
C        subroutine of the form
C
C           SUBROUTINE  JAC (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, PD, NROWPD)
C           INTEGER  NEQ, ML, MU, NRWOPD
C           DOUBLE PRECISION  T, Y(*), PD(NROWPD,*)
C
C        which provides df/dy by loading PD as follows:
C        - For a full Jacobian (MF = 21), load PD(i,j) with df(i)/dy(j),
C          the partial derivative of f(i) with respect to y(j).  (Ignore
C          the ML and MU arguments in this case.)
C        - For a banded Jacobian (MF = 24), load PD(i-j+MU+1,j) with
C          df(i)/dy(j); i.e., load the diagonal lines of df/dy into the
C          rows of PD from the top down.
C        - In either case, only nonzero elements need be loaded.
C
C     d. Write a main program that calls subroutine DLSODE once for each
C        point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
C        for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
C        by DLSODE.
C
C        Before the first call to DLSODE, set ISTATE = 1, set Y and T to
C        the initial values, and set TOUT to the first output point.  To
C        continue the integration after a successful return, simply
C        reset TOUT and call DLSODE again.  No other parameters need be
C        reset.
C
C *Examples:
C     The following is a simple example problem, with the coding needed
C     for its solution by DLSODE. The problem is from chemical kinetics,
C     and consists of the following three rate equations:
C
C        dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.E4*y2*y3
C        dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.E4*y2*y3 - 3.E7*y2**2
C        dy3/dt = 3.E7*y2**2
C
C     on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.E10, with initial conditions
C     y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0. The problem is stiff.
C
C     The following coding solves this problem with DLSODE, using
C     MF = 21 and printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.E10.  It uses
C     ITOL = 2 and ATOL much smaller for y2 than for y1 or y3 because y2
C     has much smaller values.  At the end of the run, statistical
C     quantities of interest are printed.

C
C *Accuracy:
C     The accuracy of the solution depends on the choice of tolerances
C     RTOL and ATOL.  Actual (global) errors may exceed these local
C     tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
C
C *Cautions:
C     The work arrays should not be altered between calls to DLSODE for
C     the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and optional
C     inputs.
C
C *Portability:
C     Since NEQ is dimensioned inside DLSODE, some compilers may object
C     to a call to DLSODE with NEQ a scalar variable.  In this event,
C     use DIMENSION NEQ(1).  Similar remarks apply to RTOL and ATOL.
C
C     Note to Cray users:
C     For maximum efficiency, use the CFT77 compiler.  Appropriate
C     compiler optimization directives have been inserted for CFT77.

C
C *Long Description:
C     The following complete description of the user interface to
C     DLSODE consists of four parts:
C
C     1.  The call sequence to subroutine DLSODE, which is a driver
C         routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
C         the call sequence arguments and user-supplied routines.
C         Following these descriptions is a description of optional
C         inputs available through the call sequence, and then a
C         description of optional outputs in the work arrays.
C
C     2.  Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODE package that may
C         be (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability
C         to alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
C         COMMON, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
C
C     3.  Descriptions of COMMON block to be declared in overlay or
C         similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
C         of the problem and continued solution later.
C
C     4.  Description of two routines in the DLSODE package, either of
C         which the user may replace with his own version, if desired.
C         These relate to the measurement of errors.
C
C
C                         Part 1.  Call Sequence
C                         ----------------------
C
C     Arguments
C     ---------
C     The call sequence parameters used for input only are
C
C        F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, MF,
C
C     and those used for both input and output are
C
C        Y, T, ISTATE.
C
C     The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
C     optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here
C     refers to the return from subroutine DLSODE to the user's calling
C     program.)
C
C     The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
C     initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
C     change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
C
C     The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
C
C     F        The name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the ODE
C              system.  The system must be put in the first-order form
C              dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function of
C              the scalar t and the vector y. Subroutine F is to compute
C              the function f. It is to have the form
C
C                 SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
C                 DOUBLE PRECISION  T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
C
C              where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT =
C              f(T,Y) is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
C              Subroutine F should not alter Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).  F must be
C              declared EXTERNAL in the calling program.
C
C              Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in
C              NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),..., if NEQ is an array
C              (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
C              See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
C
C              If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
C              externally to DLSODE, an extra call to F should be made
C              for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
C              If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY
C              instead.
C
C     NEQ      The size of the ODE system (number of first-order
C              ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
C              NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the
C              problem.  If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input),
C              the remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed,
C              if these are to be accessed in F and/or JAC.
C
C              Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred
C              to as a scalar in this user interface description.
C              However, NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the
C              system size.  (The DLSODE package accesses only NEQ(1).)
C              In either case, this parameter is passed as the NEQ
C              argument in all calls to F and JAC.  Hence, if it is an
C              array, locations NEQ(2),... may be used to store other
C              integer data and pass it to F and/or JAC.  Subroutines
C              F and/or JAC must include NEQ in a DIMENSION statement
C              in that case.
C
C     Y        A real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
C              length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on
C              the first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on
C              other calls.  On the first call, Y must contain the
C              vector of initial values.  On output, Y contains the
C              computed solution vector, evaluated at T. If desired,
C              the Y array may be used for other purposes between
C              calls to the solver.
C
C              This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to F
C              and JAC.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ, and locations
C              Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real data and
C              pass it to F and/or JAC.  (The DLSODE package accesses
C              only Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).)
C
C     T        The independent variable.  On input, T is used only on
C              the first call, as the initial point of the integration.
C              On output, after each call, T is the value at which a
C              computed solution Y is evaluated (usually the same as
C              TOUT).  On an error return, T is the farthest point
C              reached.
C
C     TOUT     The next value of T at which a computed solution is
C              desired.  Used only for input.
C
C              When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
C              to T for one call, then should not equal T for the next
C              call.  For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .NE. T
C              is used in order to determine the direction of the
C              integration (i.e., the algebraic sign of the step sizes)
C              and the rough scale of the problem.  Integration in
C              either direction (forward or backward in T) is permitted.
C
C              If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored
C              after the first call (i.e., the first call with
C              TOUT .NE. T).  Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
C
C              If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
C              monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
C              to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
C              TCUR - HU and TCUR.  (See "Optional Outputs" below for
C              TCUR and HU.)
C
C
C     ITOL     An indicator for the type of error control.  See
C              description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
C
C     RTOL     A relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C              an array of length NEQ.  See description below under
C              ATOL.  Input only.
C
C     ATOL     An absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C              an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
C
C              The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine the
C              error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
C              control the vector e = (e(i)) of estimated local errors
C              in Y, according to an inequality of the form
C
C                 rms-norm of ( e(i)/EWT(i) ) <= 1,
C
C              where
C
C                 EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
C
C              and the rms-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
C
C                 rms-norm(v) = SQRT(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).
C
C              Here EWT = (EWT(i)) is a vector of weights which must
C              always be positive, and the values of RTOL and ATOL
C              should all be nonnegative.  The following table gives the
C              types (scalar/array) of RTOL and ATOL, and the
C              corresponding form of EWT(i).
C
C              ITOL    RTOL      ATOL      EWT(i)
C              ----    ------    ------    -----------------------------
C              1       scalar    scalar    RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              2       scalar    array     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C              3       array     scalar    RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              4       array     array     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C
C              When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
C              be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
C
C              If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
C              fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
C              error controls can be obtained by substituting
C              user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
C              the norm calculation.  See Part 4 below.
C
C              If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
C              run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
C              components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e., of EWT) should be
C              scaled down uniformly.
C
C     ITASK    An index specifying the task to be performed.  Input
C              only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings:
C              1   Normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C                  t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
C              2   Take one step only and return.
C              3   Stop at the first internal mesh point at or beyond
C                  t = TOUT and return.
C              4   Normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C                  t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.  TCRIT
C                  must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to or
C                  beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
C                  integration.  This option is useful if the problem
C                  has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
C              5   Take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
C                  TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
C
C              Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
C              (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
C              indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before
C              TCRIT, in which case answers at T = TOUT are returned
C              first).
C
C     ISTATE   An index used for input and output to specify the state
C              of the calculation.
C
C              On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows:
C              1   This is the first call for the problem
C                  (initializations will be done).  See "Note" below.
C              2   This is not the first call, and the calculation is to
C                  continue normally, with no change in any input
C                  parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.  (If ITOL,
C                  RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls with
C                  ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
C                  tested for legality.)
C              3   This is not the first call, and the calculation is to
C                  continue normally, but with a change in input
C                  parameters other than TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are
C                  allowed in NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
C                  ML, MU, and any of the optional inputs except H0.
C                  (See IWORK description for ML and MU.)
C
C              Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted as
C              a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
C              input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
C              purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)  Thus the
C              first call for which TOUT .NE. T requires ISTATE = 1 on
C              input.
C
C              On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings:
C               1  Nothing was done, as TOUT was equal to T with
C                  ISTATE = 1 on input.
C               2  The integration was performed successfully.
C              -1  An excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP steps)
C                  was done on this call, before completing the
C                  requested task, but the integration was otherwise
C                  successful as far as T. (MXSTEP is an optional input
C                  and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
C                  simply reset ISTATE to a value >1 and call again (the
C                  excess work step counter will be reset to 0).  In
C                  addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid this
C                  error return; see "Optional Inputs" below.
C              -2  Too much accuracy was requested for the precision of
C                  the machine being used.  This was detected before
C                  completing the requested task, but the integration
C                  was successful as far as T. To continue, the
C                  tolerance parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must
C                  be set to 3. The optional output TOLSF may be used
C                  for this purpose.  (Note:  If this condition is
C                  detected before taking any steps, then an illegal
C                  input return (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
C              -3  Illegal input was detected, before taking any
C                  integration steps.  See written message for details.
C                  (Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of
C                  calls to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
C                  the run to stop.)
C              -4  There were repeated error-test failures on one
C                  attempted step, before completing the requested task,
C                  but the integration was successful as far as T.  The
C                  problem may have a singularity, or the input may be
C                  inappropriate.
C              -5  There were repeated convergence-test failures on one
C                  attempted step, before completing the requested task,
C                  but the integration was successful as far as T. This
C                  may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix, if
C                  one is being used.
C              -6  EWT(i) became zero for some i during the integration.
C                  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0) was
C                  requested on a variable which has now vanished.  The
C                  integration was successful as far as T.
C
C              Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2, it
C              does not need to be reset for normal continuation.  Also,
C              since a negative input value of ISTATE will be regarded
C              as illegal, a negative output value requires the user to
C              change it, and possibly other inputs, before calling the
C              solver again.
C
C     IOPT     An integer flag to specify whether any optional inputs
C              are being used on this call.  Input only.  The optional
C              inputs are listed under a separate heading below.
C              0   No optional inputs are being used.  Default values
C                  will be used in all cases.
C              1   One or more optional inputs are being used.
C
C     RWORK    A real working array (double precision).  The length of
C              RWORK must be at least
C
C                 20 + NYH*(MAXORD + 1) + 3*NEQ + LWM
C
C              where
C                 NYH = the initial value of NEQ,
C              MAXORD = 12 (if METH = 1) or 5 (if METH = 2) (unless a
C                       smaller value is given as an optional input),
C                 LWM = 0           if MITER = 0,
C                 LWM = NEQ**2 + 2  if MITER = 1 or 2,
C                 LWM = NEQ + 2     if MITER = 3, and
C                 LWM = (2*ML + MU + 1)*NEQ + 2
C                                   if MITER = 4 or 5.
C              (See the MF description below for METH and MITER.)
C
C              Thus if MAXORD has its default value and NEQ is constant,
C              this length is:
C              20 + 16*NEQ                    for MF = 10,
C              22 + 16*NEQ + NEQ**2           for MF = 11 or 12,
C              22 + 17*NEQ                    for MF = 13,
C              22 + 17*NEQ + (2*ML + MU)*NEQ  for MF = 14 or 15,
C              20 +  9*NEQ                    for MF = 20,
C              22 +  9*NEQ + NEQ**2           for MF = 21 or 22,
C              22 + 10*NEQ                    for MF = 23,
C              22 + 10*NEQ + (2*ML + MU)*NEQ  for MF = 24 or 25.
C
C              The first 20 words of RWORK are reserved for conditional
C              and optional inputs and optional outputs.
C
C              The following word in RWORK is a conditional input:
C              RWORK(1) = TCRIT, the critical value of t which the
C                         solver is not to overshoot.  Required if ITASK
C                         is 4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  See ITASK.
C
C     LRW      The length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
C              (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C     IWORK    An integer work array.  Its length must be at least
C              20       if MITER = 0 or 3 (MF = 10, 13, 20, 23), or
C              20 + NEQ otherwise (MF = 11, 12, 14, 15, 21, 22, 24, 25).
C              (See the MF description below for MITER.)  The first few
C              words of IWORK are used for conditional and optional
C              inputs and optional outputs.
C
C              The following two words in IWORK are conditional inputs:
C              IWORK(1) = ML   These are the lower and upper half-
C              IWORK(2) = MU   bandwidths, respectively, of the banded
C                              Jacobian, excluding the main diagonal.
C                         The band is defined by the matrix locations
C                         (i,j) with i - ML <= j <= i + MU. ML and MU
C                         must satisfy 0 <= ML,MU <= NEQ - 1. These are
C                         required if MITER is 4 or 5, and ignored
C                         otherwise.  ML and MU may in fact be the band
C                         parameters for a matrix to which df/dy is only
C                         approximately equal.
C
C     LIW      The length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
C              (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C     Note:  The work arrays must not be altered between calls to DLSODE
C     for the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and
C     optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
C     The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
C     available for use by the user outside DLSODE between calls, if
C     desired (but not for use by F or JAC).
C
C     JAC      The name of the user-supplied routine (MITER = 1 or 4) to
C              compute the Jacobian matrix, df/dy, as a function of the
C              scalar t and the vector y.  (See the MF description below
C              for MITER.)  It is to have the form
C
C                 SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, PD, NROWPD)
C                 DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), PD(NROWPD,*)
C
C              where NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, and NROWPD are input and the
C              array PD is to be loaded with partial derivatives
C              (elements of the Jacobian matrix) on output.  PD must be
C              given a first dimension of NROWPD.  T and Y have the same
C              meaning as in subroutine F.
C
C              In the full matrix case (MITER = 1), ML and MU are
C              ignored, and the Jacobian is to be loaded into PD in
C              columnwise manner, with df(i)/dy(j) loaded into PD(i,j).
C
C              In the band matrix case (MITER = 4), the elements within
C              the band are to be loaded into PD in columnwise manner,
C              with diagonal lines of df/dy loaded into the rows of PD.
C              Thus df(i)/dy(j) is to be loaded into PD(i-j+MU+1,j).  ML
C              and MU are the half-bandwidth parameters (see IWORK).
C              The locations in PD in the two triangular areas which
C              correspond to nonexistent matrix elements can be ignored
C              or loaded arbitrarily, as they are overwritten by DLSODE.
C
C              JAC need not provide df/dy exactly. A crude approximation
C              (possibly with a smaller bandwidth) will do.
C
C              In either case, PD is preset to zero by the solver, so
C              that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
C              Each call to JAC is preceded by a call to F with the same
C              arguments NEQ, T, and Y. Thus to gain some efficiency,
C              intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may
C              be saved in a user COMMON block by F and not recomputed
C              by JAC, if desired.  Also, JAC may alter the Y array, if
C              desired.  JAC must be declared EXTERNAL in the calling
C              program.
C
C              Subroutine JAC may access user-defined quantities in
C              NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C              (dimensioned in JAC) and/or Y has length exceeding
C              NEQ(1).  See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
C
C     MF       The method flag.  Used only for input.  The legal values
C              of MF are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24,
C              and 25.  MF has decimal digits METH and MITER:
C                 MF = 10*METH + MITER .
C
C              METH indicates the basic linear multistep method:
C              1   Implicit Adams method.
C              2   Method based on backward differentiation formulas
C                  (BDF's).
C
C              MITER indicates the corrector iteration method:
C              0   Functional iteration (no Jacobian matrix is
C                  involved).
C              1   Chord iteration with a user-supplied full (NEQ by
C                  NEQ) Jacobian.
C              2   Chord iteration with an internally generated
C                  (difference quotient) full Jacobian (using NEQ
C                  extra calls to F per df/dy value).
C              3   Chord iteration with an internally generated
C                  diagonal Jacobian approximation (using one extra call
C                  to F per df/dy evaluation).
C              4   Chord iteration with a user-supplied banded Jacobian.
C              5   Chord iteration with an internally generated banded
C                  Jacobian (using ML + MU + 1 extra calls to F per
C                  df/dy evaluation).
C
C              If MITER = 1 or 4, the user must supply a subroutine JAC
C              (the name is arbitrary) as described above under JAC.
C              For other values of MITER, a dummy argument can be used.
C
C     Optional Inputs
C     ---------------
C     The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
C     call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
C     this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
C     location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
C     The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that case
C     all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any of
C     these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
C     Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
C     locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively,
C     and then set those of interest to nonzero values.
C
C     Name    Location   Meaning and default value
C     ------  ---------  -----------------------------------------------
C     H0      RWORK(5)   Step size to be attempted on the first step.
C                        The default value is determined by the solver.
C     HMAX    RWORK(6)   Maximum absolute step size allowed.  The
C                        default value is infinite.
C     HMIN    RWORK(7)   Minimum absolute step size allowed.  The
C                        default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
C                        enforced on the final step before reaching
C                        TCRIT when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
C     MAXORD  IWORK(5)   Maximum order to be allowed.  The default value
C                        is 12 if METH = 1, and 5 if METH = 2. (See the
C                        MF description above for METH.)  If MAXORD
C                        exceeds the default value, it will be reduced
C                        to the default value.  If MAXORD is changed
C                        during the problem, it may cause the current
C                        order to be reduced.
C     MXSTEP  IWORK(6)   Maximum number of (internally defined) steps
C                        allowed during one call to the solver.  The
C                        default value is 500.
C     MXHNIL  IWORK(7)   Maximum number of messages printed (per
C                        problem) warning that T + H = T on a step
C                        (H = step size).  This must be positive to
C                        result in a nondefault value.  The default
C                        value is 10.
C
C     Optional Outputs
C     ----------------
C     As optional additional output from DLSODE, the variables listed
C     below are quantities related to the performance of DLSODE which
C     are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of the
C     work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
C     Except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined on
C     any successful return from DLSODE, and on any return with ISTATE =
C     -1, -2, -4, -5, or -6.  On an illegal input return (ISTATE = -3),
C     they will be unchanged from their existing values (if any), except
C     possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.  On any error return,
C     outputs relevant to the error will be defined, as noted below.
C
C     Name   Location   Meaning
C     -----  ---------  ------------------------------------------------
C     HU     RWORK(11)  Step size in t last used (successfully).
C     HCUR   RWORK(12)  Step size to be attempted on the next step.
C     TCUR   RWORK(13)  Current value of the independent variable which
C                       the solver has actually reached, i.e., the
C                       current internal mesh point in t. On output,
C                       TCUR will always be at least as far as the
C                       argument T, but may be farther (if interpolation
C                       was done).
C     TOLSF  RWORK(14)  Tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
C                       computed when a request for too much accuracy
C                       was detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the
C                       start of the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).
C                       If ITOL is left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are
C                       uniformly scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the
C                       next call, then the solver is deemed likely to
C                       succeed.  (The user may also ignore TOLSF and
C                       alter the tolerance parameters in any other way
C                       appropriate.)
C     NST    IWORK(11)  Number of steps taken for the problem so far.
C     NFE    IWORK(12)  Number of F evaluations for the problem so far.
C     NJE    IWORK(13)  Number of Jacobian evaluations (and of matrix LU
C                       decompositions) for the problem so far.
C     NQU    IWORK(14)  Method order last used (successfully).
C     NQCUR  IWORK(15)  Order to be attempted on the next step.
C     IMXER  IWORK(16)  Index of the component of largest magnitude in
C                       the weighted local error vector ( e(i)/EWT(i) ),
C                       on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
C     LENRW  IWORK(17)  Length of RWORK actually required.  This is
C                       defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                       input return for insufficient storage.
C     LENIW  IWORK(18)  Length of IWORK actually required.  This is
C                       defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                       input return for insufficient storage.
C
C     The following two arrays are segments of the RWORK array which may
C     also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.  For each
C     array, the table below gives its internal name, its base address
C     in RWORK, and its description.
C
C     Name  Base address  Description
C     ----  ------------  ----------------------------------------------
C     YH    21            The Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
C                         (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value of
C                         NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j + 1 of
C                         YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times the jth
C                         derivative of the interpolating polynomial
C                         currently representing the solution, evaluated
C                         at t = TCUR.
C     ACOR  LENRW-NEQ+1   Array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
C                         corrections on each step, scaled on output to
C                         represent the estimated local error in Y on
C                         the last step.  This is the vector e in the
C                         description of the error control.  It is
C                         defined only on successful return from DLSODE.
C
C
C                    Part 2.  Other Callable Routines
C                    --------------------------------
C
C     The following are optional calls which the user may make to gain
C     additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSODE.
C
C     Form of call              Function
C     ------------------------  ----------------------------------------
C     CALL XSETUN(LUN)          Set the logical unit number, LUN, for
C                               output of messages from DLSODE, if the
C                               default is not desired.  The default
C                               value of LUN is 6. This call may be made
C                               at any time and will take effect
C                               immediately.
C     CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         Set a flag to control the printing of
C                               messages by DLSODE.  MFLAG = 0 means do
C                               not print.  (Danger:  this risks losing
C                               valuable information.)  MFLAG = 1 means
C                               print (the default).  This call may be
C                               made at any time and will take effect
C                               immediately.
C     CALL DSRCOM(RSAV,ISAV,JOB)  Saves and restores the contents of the
C                               internal COMMON blocks used by DLSODE
C                               (see Part 3 below).  RSAV must be a
C                               real array of length 218 or more, and
C                               ISAV must be an integer array of length
C                               37 or more.  JOB = 1 means save COMMON

C     CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        Provide derivatives of y, of various
C     (see below)               orders, at a specified point t, if
C                               desired.  It may be called only after a
C                               successful return from DLSODE.  Detailed
C                               instructions follow.
C
C     Detailed instructions for using DINTDY
C     --------------------------------------
C     The form of the CALL is:
C
C           CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(21), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
C
C     The input parameters are:
C
C     T          Value of independent variable where answers are
C                desired (normally the same as the T last returned by
C                DLSODE).  For valid results, T must lie between
C                TCUR - HU and TCUR.  (See "Optional Outputs" above
C                for TCUR and HU.)
C     K          Integer order of the derivative desired.  K must
C                satisfy 0 <= K <= NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current
C                order (see "Optional Outputs").  The capability
C                corresponding to K = 0, i.e., computing y(t), is
C                already provided by DLSODE directly.  Since
C                NQCUR >= 1, the first derivative dy/dt is always
C                available with DINTDY.
C     RWORK(21)  The base address of the history array YH.
C     NYH        Column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
C
C     The output parameters are:
C
C     DKY        Real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
C                of the Kth derivative of y(t).
C     IFLAG      Integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
C                -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
C                On an error return, a message is also written.

C                          Part 3.  Common Blocks
C                          ----------------------
C
C     If DLSODE is to be used in an overlay situation, the user must
C     declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
C     (1) the call sequence to DLSODE,
C     (2) the internal COMMON block /DLS001/, of length 255
C         (218 double precision words followed by 37 integer words).
C
C     If DLSODE is used on a system in which the contents of internal
C     COMMON blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
C     declare the above COMMON block in his main program to insure that
C     its contents are preserved.
C
C     If the solution of a given problem by DLSODE is to be interrupted
C     and then later continued, as when restarting an interrupted run or
C     alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
C     following the return from the last DLSODE call prior to the
C     interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
C     internal COMMON block, and later restore these values before the
C     next DLSODE call for that problem.   In addition, if XSETUN and/or
C     XSETF was called for non-default handling of error messages, then
C     these calls must be repeated.  To save and restore the COMMON
C     block, use subroutine DSRCOM (see Part 2 above).
C
C
C              Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines
C              -----------------------------------------------
C
C     Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSODE package which
C     relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
C     replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since
C     such a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it
C     should be done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great
C     caution.  (Note:  The means by which the package version of a
C     routine is superseded by the user's version may be system-
C     dependent.)
C
C     DEWSET
C     ------
C     The following subroutine is called just before each internal
C     integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
C     described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
C
C           SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
C
C     where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODE call
C     sequence, YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector,
C     and EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
C
C     If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
C     (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
C     in Y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the
C     DVNORM routine (see below), and also used by DLSODE in the
C     computation of the optional output IMXER, the diagonal Jacobian
C     approximation, and the increments for difference quotient
C     Jacobians.
C
C     In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
C     the current values of derivatives of y. Derivatives up to order NQ
C     are available from the history array YH, described above under
C     optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
C     extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
C     factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
C     given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
C     NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
C     can be obtained by including in SEWSET the statements:
C           DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
C           COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
C           NQ = ILS(33)
C           NST = ILS(34)
C           H = RLS(212)
C     Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
C     YCUR(NYH+i)/H (i=1,...,NEQ) (and the division by H is unnecessary
C     when NST = 0).
C
C     DVNORM
C     ------
C     DVNORM is a real function routine which computes the weighted
C     root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
C
C        d = DVNORM (n, v, w)
C
C     where:
C     n = the length of the vector,
C     v = real array of length n containing the vector,
C     w = real array of length n containing weights,
C     d = SQRT( (1/n) * sum(v(i)*w(i))**2 ).
C
C     DVNORM is called with n = NEQ and with w(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
C     EWT is as set by subroutine DEWSET.
C
C     If the user supplies this function, it should return a nonnegative
C     value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSODE.
C     None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.  For example, a
C     user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
C     - Substitute a max-norm of (v(i)*w(i)) for the rms-norm, or
C     - Ignore some components of v in the norm, with the effect of
C       suppressing the error control on those components of Y.

C This is the 12 November 2003 version of
C DLSODES: Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations
C          with general Sparse Jacobian matrix.
C
C This version is in double precision.
C
C DLSODES solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
C systems of first order ODEs,
C     dy/dt = f(t,y) ,  or, in component form,
C     dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ)) (i = 1,...,NEQ).
C DLSODES is a variant of the DLSODE package, and is intended for
C problems in which the Jacobian matrix df/dy has an arbitrary
C sparse structure (when the problem is stiff).

C Summary of Usage.
C
C Communication between the user and the DLSODES package, for normal
C situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
C of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
C details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
C and instructions for special situations.  See also the example
C problem (with program and output) following this summary.
C
C A. First provide a subroutine of the form:
C               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
C which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with f(i).
C
C B. Next determine (or guess) whether or not the problem is stiff.
C Stiffness occurs when the Jacobian matrix df/dy has an eigenvalue
C whose real part is negative and large in magnitude, compared to the
C reciprocal of the t span of interest.  If the problem is nonstiff,
C use a method flag MF = 10.  If it is stiff, there are two standard
C choices for the method flag, MF = 121 and MF = 222.  In both cases,
C DLSODES requires the Jacobian matrix in some form, and it treats this
C matrix in general sparse form, with sparsity structure determined
C internally.  (For options where the user supplies the sparsity
C structure, see the full description of MF below.)
C
C C. If the problem is stiff, you are encouraged to supply the Jacobian
C directly (MF = 121), but if this is not feasible, DLSODES will
C compute it internally by difference quotients (MF = 222).
C If you are supplying the Jacobian, provide a subroutine of the form:
C               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, J, IAN, JAN, PDJ)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), IAN(*), JAN(*), PDJ(*)
C Here NEQ, T, Y, and J are input arguments, and the JAC routine is to
C load the array PDJ (of length NEQ) with the J-th column of df/dy.
C I.e., load PDJ(i) with df(i)/dy(J) for all relevant values of i.
C The arguments IAN and JAN should be ignored for normal situations.
C DLSODES will call the JAC routine with J = 1,2,...,NEQ.
C Only nonzero elements need be loaded.  Usually, a crude approximation
C to df/dy, possibly with fewer nonzero elements, will suffice.
C
C D. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODES once for
C each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
C for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages by
C DLSODES.  On the first call to DLSODES, supply arguments as follows:
C F      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
C          This name must be declared External in calling program.
C NEQ    = number of first order ODEs.
C Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
C T      = the initial value of the independent variable t.
C TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
C ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
C RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
C ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
C          The estimated local error in Y(i) will be controlled so as
C          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
C          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
C          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
C          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
C          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
C          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
C          control.  Caution: actual (global) errors may exceed these
C          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
C ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of Y at t = TOUT.
C ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1.
C IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
C RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
C             20 + 16*NEQ            for MF = 10,
C             20 + (2 + 1./LENRAT)*NNZ + (11 + 9./LENRAT)*NEQ
C                                    for MF = 121 or 222,
C          where:
C          NNZ    = the number of nonzero elements in the sparse
C                   Jacobian (if this is unknown, use an estimate), and
C          LENRAT = the real to integer wordlength ratio (usually 1 in
C                   single precision and 2 in double precision).
C          In any case, the required size of RWORK cannot generally
C          be predicted in advance if MF = 121 or 222, and the value
C          above is a rough estimate of a crude lower bound.  Some
C          experimentation with this size may be necessary.
C          (When known, the correct required length is an optional
C          output, available in IWORK(17).)
C LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user dimension).
C IWORK  = integer work array of length at least 30.
C LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user dimension).
C JAC    = name of subroutine for Jacobian matrix (MF = 121).
C          If used, this name must be declared External in calling
C          program.  If not used, pass a dummy name.
C MF     = method flag.  Standard values are:
C          10  for nonstiff (Adams) method, no Jacobian used
C          121 for stiff (BDF) method, user-supplied sparse Jacobian
C          222 for stiff method, internally generated sparse Jacobian
C Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, RWORK, IWORK,
C and possibly ATOL.
C
C E. The output from the first call (or any call) is:
C      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
C      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
C ISTATE = 2  if DLSODES was successful, negative otherwise.
C          -1 means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong MF).
C          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
C          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
C          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
C          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian
C             supplied or wrong choice of MF or tolerances).
C          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
C             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
C          -7 means a fatal error return flag came from sparse solver
C             CDRV by way of DPRJS or DSOLSS.  Should never happen.
C          A return with ISTATE = -1, -4, or -5 may result from using
C          an inappropriate sparsity structure, one that is quite
C          different from the initial structure.  Consider calling
C          DLSODES again with ISTATE = 3 to force the structure to be
C          reevaluated.  See the full description of ISTATE below.
C
C F. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
C reset TOUT and call DLSODES again.  No other parameters need be reset.

C Example Problem.
C
C The following is a simple example problem, with the coding
C needed for its solution by DLSODES.  The problem is from chemical
C kinetics, and consists of the following 12 rate equations:
C    dy1/dt  = -rk1*y1
C    dy2/dt  = rk1*y1 + rk11*rk14*y4 + rk19*rk14*y5
C                - rk3*y2*y3 - rk15*y2*y12 - rk2*y2
C    dy3/dt  = rk2*y2 - rk5*y3 - rk3*y2*y3 - rk7*y10*y3
C                + rk11*rk14*y4 + rk12*rk14*y6
C    dy4/dt  = rk3*y2*y3 - rk11*rk14*y4 - rk4*y4
C    dy5/dt  = rk15*y2*y12 - rk19*rk14*y5 - rk16*y5
C    dy6/dt  = rk7*y10*y3 - rk12*rk14*y6 - rk8*y6
C    dy7/dt  = rk17*y10*y12 - rk20*rk14*y7 - rk18*y7
C    dy8/dt  = rk9*y10 - rk13*rk14*y8 - rk10*y8
C    dy9/dt  = rk4*y4 + rk16*y5 + rk8*y6 + rk18*y7
C    dy10/dt = rk5*y3 + rk12*rk14*y6 + rk20*rk14*y7
C                + rk13*rk14*y8 - rk7*y10*y3 - rk17*y10*y12
C                - rk6*y10 - rk9*y10
C    dy11/dt = rk10*y8
C    dy12/dt = rk6*y10 + rk19*rk14*y5 + rk20*rk14*y7
C                - rk15*y2*y12 - rk17*y10*y12
C
C with rk1 = rk5 = 0.1,  rk4 = rk8 = rk16 = rk18 = 2.5,
C      rk10 = 5.0,  rk2 = rk6 = 10.0,  rk14 = 30.0,
C      rk3 = rk7 = rk9 = rk11 = rk12 = rk13 = rk19 = rk20 = 50.0,
C      rk15 = rk17 = 100.0.
C
C The t interval is from 0 to 1000, and the initial conditions
C are y1 = 1, y2 = y3 = ... = y12 = 0.  The problem is stiff.
C
C The following coding solves this problem with DLSODES, using MF = 121
C and printing results at t = .1, 1., 10., 100., 1000.  It uses
C ITOL = 1 and mixed relative/absolute tolerance controls.
C During the run and at the end, statistical quantities of interest
C are printed (see optional outputs in the full description below).

C Full Description of User Interface to DLSODES.
C
C The user interface to DLSODES consists of the following parts.
C
C 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODES, which is a driver
C      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
C      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
C      Following these descriptions is a description of
C      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
C      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
C
C 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODES package that may be
C      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
C      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
C      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
C
C 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
C      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
C      of the problem and continued solution later.
C
C 4.   Description of two routines in the DLSODES package, either of
C      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
C      These relate to the measurement of errors.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 1.  Call Sequence.
C
C The call sequence parameters used for input only are
C     F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, MF,
C and those used for both input and output are
C     Y, T, ISTATE.
C The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
C optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
C to the return from Subroutine DLSODES to the user's calling program.)
C
C The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
C initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
C change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
C
C The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
C
C F      = the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the
C          ODE system.  The system must be put in the first-order
C          form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function
C          of the scalar t and the vector y.  Subroutine F is to
C          compute the function f.  It is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
C          where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT = f(t,y)
C          is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
C          Subroutine F should not alter y(1),...,y(NEQ).
C          F must be declared External in the calling program.
C
C          Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
C
C          If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
C          externally to DLSODES, an extra call to F should be made
C          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
C          If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY instead.
C
C NEQ    = the size of the ODE system (number of first order
C          ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
C          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
C          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
C          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
C          these are to be accessed in F and/or JAC.
C
C          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
C          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
C          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
C          (The DLSODES package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
C          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
C          to F and JAC.  Hence, if it is an array, locations
C          NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data and pass
C          it to F and/or JAC.  Subroutines F and/or JAC must include
C          NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
C
C Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
C          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
C          first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on other calls.
C          on the first call, Y must contain the vector of initial
C          values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution vector,
C          evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
C          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
C
C          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to
C          F and JAC.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ, and locations
C          Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real data and
C          pass it to F and/or JAC.  (The DLSODES package accesses only
C          Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).)
C
C T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
C          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
C          on output, after each call, T is the value at which a
C          computed solution Y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
C          On an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
C
C TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
C          Used only for input.
C
C          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
C          to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next call.
C          For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is used
C          in order to determine the direction of the integration
C          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
C          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
C          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
C
C          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
C          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
C          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
C
C          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
C          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
C          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
C          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
C          TCUR and HU).
C
C ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
C          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
C
C RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
C          Input only.
C
C ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
C
C             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
C          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
C          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
C          in y, according to an inequality of the form
C                      RMS-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
C          where       EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
C          and the RMS-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
C          RMS-norm(v) = SQRT(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).  Here EWT = (EWT(i))
C          is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
C          the values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
C          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
C          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
C
C             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
C              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              4     array      array      RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C
C          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
C          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
C
C          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
C          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
C          error controls can be obtained by substituting
C          user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
C          the norm calculation.  See Part 4 below.
C
C          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
C          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
C          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
C          down uniformly.
C
C ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
C          Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
C          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
C          2  means take one step only and return.
C          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
C             beyond t = TOUT and return.
C          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
C             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
C             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
C             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
C          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
C
C          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
C          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
C          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
C          in which case answers at t = TOUT are returned first).
C
C ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
C          the state of the calculation.
C
C          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
C          1  means this is the first call for the problem
C             (initializations will be done).  See note below.
C          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
C             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
C             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
C             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
C             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
C             tested for legality.)
C          3  means this is not the first call, and the
C             calculation is to continue normally, but with
C             a change in input parameters other than
C             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
C             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
C             the conditional inputs IA and JA,
C             and any of the optional inputs except H0.
C             In particular, if MITER = 1 or 2, a call with ISTATE = 3
C             will cause the sparsity structure of the problem to be
C             recomputed (or reread from IA and JA if MOSS = 0).
C          Note:  a preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
C          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
C          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
C          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
C          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
C          ISTATE = 1 on input.
C
C          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
C           1  means nothing was done; TOUT = T and ISTATE = 1 on input.
C           2  means the integration was performed successfully.
C          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
C              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
C              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
C              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
C              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
C              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
C              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
C              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
C              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
C          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
C              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
C              completing the requested task, but the integration
C              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
C              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
C              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
C              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
C              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
C              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
C          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
C              integration steps.  See written message for details.
C              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
C              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
C              the run to stop.
C          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
C              may be inappropriate.
C          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix,
C              if one is being used.
C          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
C              integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0)
C              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
C              The integration was successful as far as T.
C          -7  means a fatal error return flag came from the sparse
C              solver CDRV by way of DPRJS or DSOLSS (numerical
C              factorization or backsolve).  This should never happen.
C              The integration was successful as far as T.
C
C          Note: an error return with ISTATE = -1, -4, or -5 and with
C          MITER = 1 or 2 may mean that the sparsity structure of the
C          problem has changed significantly since it was last
C          determined (or input).  In that case, one can attempt to
C          complete the integration by setting ISTATE = 3 on the next
C          call, so that a new structure determination is done.
C
C          Note:  since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
C          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
C          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
C          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
C          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
C          calling the solver again.
C
C IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
C          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
C          The optional inputs are listed separately below.
C          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
C                   Default values will be used in all cases.
C          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
C
C RWORK  = a work array used for a mixture of real (double precision)
C          and integer work space.
C          The length of RWORK (in real words) must be at least
C             20 + NYH*(MAXORD + 1) + 3*NEQ + LWM    where
C          NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
C          MAXORD = 12 (if METH = 1) or 5 (if METH = 2) (unless a
C                   smaller value is given as an optional input),
C          LWM = 0                                    if MITER = 0,
C          LWM = 2*NNZ + 2*NEQ + (NNZ+9*NEQ)/LENRAT   if MITER = 1,
C          LWM = 2*NNZ + 2*NEQ + (NNZ+10*NEQ)/LENRAT  if MITER = 2,
C          LWM = NEQ + 2                              if MITER = 3.
C          In the above formulas,
C          NNZ    = number of nonzero elements in the Jacobian matrix.
C          LENRAT = the real to integer wordlength ratio (usually 1 in
C                   single precision and 2 in double precision).
C          (See the MF description for METH and MITER.)
C          Thus if MAXORD has its default value and NEQ is constant,
C          the minimum length of RWORK is:
C             20 + 16*NEQ        for MF = 10,
C             20 + 16*NEQ + LWM  for MF = 11, 111, 211, 12, 112, 212,
C             22 + 17*NEQ        for MF = 13,
C             20 +  9*NEQ        for MF = 20,
C             20 +  9*NEQ + LWM  for MF = 21, 121, 221, 22, 122, 222,
C             22 + 10*NEQ        for MF = 23.
C          If MITER = 1 or 2, the above formula for LWM is only a
C          crude lower bound.  The required length of RWORK cannot
C          be readily predicted in general, as it depends on the
C          sparsity structure of the problem.  Some experimentation
C          may be necessary.
C
C          The first 20 words of RWORK are reserved for conditional
C          and optional inputs and optional outputs.
C
C          The following word in RWORK is a conditional input:
C            RWORK(1) = TCRIT = critical value of t which the solver
C                       is not to overshoot.  Required if ITASK is
C                       4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  (See ITASK.)
C
C LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C IWORK  = an integer work array.  The length of IWORK must be at least
C             31 + NEQ + NNZ   if MOSS = 0 and MITER = 1 or 2, or
C             30               otherwise.
C          (NNZ is the number of nonzero elements in df/dy.)
C
C          In DLSODES, IWORK is used only for conditional and
C          optional inputs and optional outputs.
C
C          The following two blocks of words in IWORK are conditional
C          inputs, required if MOSS = 0 and MITER = 1 or 2, but not
C          otherwise (see the description of MF for MOSS).
C            IWORK(30+j) = IA(j)     (j=1,...,NEQ+1)
C            IWORK(31+NEQ+k) = JA(k) (k=1,...,NNZ)
C          The two arrays IA and JA describe the sparsity structure
C          to be assumed for the Jacobian matrix.  JA contains the row
C          indices where nonzero elements occur, reading in columnwise
C          order, and IA contains the starting locations in JA of the
C          descriptions of columns 1,...,NEQ, in that order, with
C          IA(1) = 1.  Thus, for each column index j = 1,...,NEQ, the
C          values of the row index i in column j where a nonzero
C          element may occur are given by
C            i = JA(k),  where   IA(j) .le. k .lt. IA(j+1).
C          If NNZ is the total number of nonzero locations assumed,
C          then the length of the JA array is NNZ, and IA(NEQ+1) must
C          be NNZ + 1.  Duplicate entries are not allowed.
C
C LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C Note:  The work arrays must not be altered between calls to DLSODES
C for the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and
C optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
C The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
C available for use by the user outside DLSODES between calls, if
C desired (but not for use by F or JAC).
C
C JAC    = name of user-supplied routine (MITER = 1 or MOSS = 1) to
C          compute the Jacobian matrix, df/dy, as a function of
C          the scalar t and the vector y.  It is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, J, IAN, JAN, PDJ)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), IAN(*), JAN(*), PDJ(*)
C          where NEQ, T, Y, J, IAN, and JAN are input, and the array
C          PDJ, of length NEQ, is to be loaded with column J
C          of the Jacobian on output.  Thus df(i)/dy(J) is to be
C          loaded into PDJ(i) for all relevant values of i.
C          Here T and Y have the same meaning as in Subroutine F,
C          and J is a column index (1 to NEQ).  IAN and JAN are
C          undefined in calls to JAC for structure determination
C          (MOSS = 1).  otherwise, IAN and JAN are structure
C          descriptors, as defined under optional outputs below, and
C          so can be used to determine the relevant row indices i, if
C          desired.
C               JAC need not provide df/dy exactly.  A crude
C          approximation (possibly with greater sparsity) will do.
C               In any case, PDJ is preset to zero by the solver,
C          so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
C          Calls to JAC are made with J = 1,...,NEQ, in that order, and
C          each such set of calls is preceded by a call to F with the
C          same arguments NEQ, T, and Y.  Thus to gain some efficiency,
C          intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be
C          saved in a user Common block by F and not recomputed by JAC,
C          if desired.  JAC must not alter its input arguments.
C          JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
C               Subroutine JAC may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in JAC) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
C
C MF     = the method flag.  Used only for input.
C          MF has three decimal digits-- MOSS, METH, MITER--
C             MF = 100*MOSS + 10*METH + MITER.
C          MOSS indicates the method to be used to obtain the sparsity
C          structure of the Jacobian matrix if MITER = 1 or 2:
C            MOSS = 0 means the user has supplied IA and JA
C                     (see descriptions under IWORK above).
C            MOSS = 1 means the user has supplied JAC (see below)
C                     and the structure will be obtained from NEQ
C                     initial calls to JAC.
C            MOSS = 2 means the structure will be obtained from NEQ+1
C                     initial calls to F.
C          METH indicates the basic linear multistep method:
C            METH = 1 means the implicit Adams method.
C            METH = 2 means the method based on Backward
C                     Differentiation Formulas (BDFs).
C          MITER indicates the corrector iteration method:
C            MITER = 0 means functional iteration (no Jacobian matrix
C                      is involved).
C            MITER = 1 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
C                      sparse Jacobian, given by Subroutine JAC.
C            MITER = 2 means chord iteration with an internally
C                      generated (difference quotient) sparse Jacobian
C                      (using NGP extra calls to F per df/dy value,
C                      where NGP is an optional output described below.)
C            MITER = 3 means chord iteration with an internally
C                      generated diagonal Jacobian approximation
C                      (using 1 extra call to F per df/dy evaluation).
C          If MITER = 1 or MOSS = 1, the user must supply a Subroutine
C          JAC (the name is arbitrary) as described above under JAC.
C          Otherwise, a dummy argument can be used.
C
C          The standard choices for MF are:
C            MF = 10  for a nonstiff problem,
C            MF = 21 or 22 for a stiff problem with IA/JA supplied
C                     (21 if JAC is supplied, 22 if not),
C            MF = 121 for a stiff problem with JAC supplied,
C                     but not IA/JA,
C            MF = 222 for a stiff problem with neither IA/JA nor
C                     JAC supplied.
C          The sparseness structure can be changed during the
C          problem by making a call to DLSODES with ISTATE = 3.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Inputs.
C
C The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
C call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
C this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
C location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
C The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
C case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
C of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
C Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
C locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
C then set those of interest to nonzero values.
C
C Name    Location      Meaning and Default Value
C
C H0      RWORK(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
C                   The default value is determined by the solver.
C
C HMAX    RWORK(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is infinite.
C
C HMIN    RWORK(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
C                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
C                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
C
C SETH    RWORK(8)  the element threshhold for sparsity determination
C                   when MOSS = 1 or 2.  If the absolute value of
C                   an estimated Jacobian element is .le. SETH, it
C                   will be assumed to be absent in the structure.
C                   The default value of SETH is 0.
C
C MAXORD  IWORK(5)  the maximum order to be allowed.  The default
C                   value is 12 if METH = 1, and 5 if METH = 2.
C                   If MAXORD exceeds the default value, it will
C                   be reduced to the default value.
C                   If MAXORD is changed during the problem, it may
C                   cause the current order to be reduced.
C
C MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
C                   allowed during one call to the solver.
C                   The default value is 500.
C
C MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
C                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
C                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
C                   value.  The default value is 10.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Outputs.
C
C As optional additional output from DLSODES, the variables listed
C below are quantities related to the performance of DLSODES
C which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
C the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
C Except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
C on any successful return from DLSODES, and on any return with
C ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, or -6.  On an illegal input return
C (ISTATE = -3), they will be unchanged from their existing values
C (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
C On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
C as noted below.
C
C Name    Location      Meaning
C
C HU      RWORK(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
C
C HCUR    RWORK(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
C
C TCUR    RWORK(13) the current value of the independent variable
C                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
C                   current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
C                   will always be at least as far as the argument
C                   T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
C
C TOLSF   RWORK(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
C                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
C                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
C                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
C                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
C                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
C                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
C                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
C                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
C
C NST     IWORK(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
C
C NFE     IWORK(12) the number of f evaluations for the problem so far,
C                   excluding those for structure determination
C                   (MOSS = 2).
C
C NJE     IWORK(13) the number of Jacobian evaluations for the problem
C                   so far, excluding those for structure determination
C                   (MOSS = 1).
C
C NQU     IWORK(14) the method order last used (successfully).
C
C NQCUR   IWORK(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.
C
C IMXER   IWORK(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
C                   the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
C                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
C
C LENRW   IWORK(17) the length of RWORK actually required.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C LENIW   IWORK(18) the length of IWORK actually required.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C NNZ     IWORK(19) the number of nonzero elements in the Jacobian
C                   matrix, including the diagonal (MITER = 1 or 2).
C                   (This may differ from that given by IA(NEQ+1)-1
C                   if MOSS = 0, because of added diagonal entries.)
C
C NGP     IWORK(20) the number of groups of column indices, used in
C                   difference quotient Jacobian aproximations if
C                   MITER = 2.  This is also the number of extra f
C                   evaluations needed for each Jacobian evaluation.
C
C NLU     IWORK(21) the number of sparse LU decompositions for the
C                   problem so far.
C
C LYH     IWORK(22) the base address in RWORK of the history array YH,
C                   described below in this list.
C
C IPIAN   IWORK(23) the base address of the structure descriptor array
C                   IAN, described below in this list.
C
C IPJAN   IWORK(24) the base address of the structure descriptor array
C                   JAN, described below in this list.
C
C NZL     IWORK(25) the number of nonzero elements in the strict lower
C                   triangle of the LU factorization used in the chord
C                   iteration (MITER = 1 or 2).
C
C NZU     IWORK(26) the number of nonzero elements in the strict upper
C                   triangle of the LU factorization used in the chord
C                   iteration (MITER = 1 or 2).
C                   The total number of nonzeros in the factorization
C                   is therefore NZL + NZU + NEQ.
C
C The following four arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
C may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
C For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
C its base address, and its description.
C For YH and ACOR, the base addresses are in RWORK (a real array).
C The integer arrays IAN and JAN are to be obtained by declaring an
C integer array IWK and identifying IWK(1) with RWORK(21), using either
C an equivalence statement or a subroutine call.  Then the base
C addresses IPIAN (of IAN) and IPJAN (of JAN) in IWK are to be obtained
C as optional outputs IWORK(23) and IWORK(24), respectively.
C Thus IAN(1) is IWK(IPIAN), etc.
C
C Name    Base Address      Description
C
C IAN    IPIAN (in IWK)  structure descriptor array of size NEQ + 1.
C JAN    IPJAN (in IWK)  structure descriptor array of size NNZ.
C         (see above)    IAN and JAN together describe the sparsity
C                        structure of the Jacobian matrix, as used by
C                        DLSODES when MITER = 1 or 2.
C                        JAN contains the row indices of the nonzero
C                        locations, reading in columnwise order, and
C                        IAN contains the starting locations in JAN of
C                        the descriptions of columns 1,...,NEQ, in
C                        that order, with IAN(1) = 1.  Thus for each
C                        j = 1,...,NEQ, the row indices i of the
C                        nonzero locations in column j are
C                        i = JAN(k),  IAN(j) .le. k .lt. IAN(j+1).
C                        Note that IAN(NEQ+1) = NNZ + 1.
C                        (If MOSS = 0, IAN/JAN may differ from the
C                        input IA/JA because of a different ordering
C                        in each column, and added diagonal entries.)
C
C YH      LYH            the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
C          (optional     (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
C           output)      of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
C                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
C                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
C                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
C                        evaluated at t = TCUR.  The base address LYH
C                        is another optional output, listed above.
C
C ACOR     LENRW-NEQ+1   array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
C                        corrections on each step, scaled on output
C                        to represent the estimated local error in y
C                        on the last step.  This is the vector E  in
C                        the description of the error control.  It is
C                        defined only on a successful return from
C                        DLSODES.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.
C
C The following are optional calls which the user may make to
C gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSODES.
C (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
C SLATEC error handling package.)
C
C     Form of Call                  Function
C   CALL XSETUN(LUN)          Set the logical unit number, LUN, for
C                             output of messages from DLSODES, if
C                             the default is not desired.
C                             The default value of LUN is 6.
C
C   CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         Set a flag to control the printing of
C                             messages by DLSODES.
C                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger:
C                             This risks losing valuable information.)
C                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).
C
C                             Either of the above calls may be made at
C                             any time and will take effect immediately.
C
C   CALL DSRCMS(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) saves and restores the contents of
C                             the internal Common blocks used by
C                             DLSODES (see Part 3 below).
C                             RSAV must be a real array of length 224
C                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
C                             array of length 71 or more.
C                             JOB=1 means save Common into RSAV/ISAV.
C                             JOB=2 means restore Common from RSAV/ISAV.
C                                DSRCMS is useful if one is
C                             interrupting a run and restarting
C                             later, or alternating between two or
C                             more problems solved with DLSODES.
C
C   CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        Provide derivatives of y, of various
C        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
C                             desired.  It may be called only after
C                             a successful return from DLSODES.
C
C The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.
C The form of the call is:
C
C   LYH = IWORK(22)
C   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(LYH), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
C
C The input parameters are:
C
C T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
C             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODES).
C             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
C             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
C K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
C             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
C             (See optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
C             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(T), is already provided
C             by DLSODES directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
C             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
C LYH       = the base address of the history array YH, obtained
C             as an optional output as shown above.
C NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
C
C The output parameters are:
C
C DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
C             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
C IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
C             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
C             On an error return, a message is also written.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 3.  Common Blocks.
C
C If DLSODES is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
C must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
C   (1) the call sequence to DLSODES, and
C   (2) the two internal Common blocks
C         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
C                      followed by 37 integer words),
C         /DLSS01/  of length  40  (6 double precision words
C                      followed by 34 integer words),
C
C If DLSODES is used on a system in which the contents of internal
C Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
C declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure
C that their contents are preserved.
C
C If the solution of a given problem by DLSODES is to be interrupted
C and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
C or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
C following the return from the last DLSODES call prior to the
C interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
C internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
C next DLSODES call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
C blocks, use Subroutine DSRCMS (see Part 2 above).
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
C
C Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSODES package which
C relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
C replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
C a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
C done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
C (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
C superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
C
C (a) DEWSET.
C The following subroutine is called just before each internal
C integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
C described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
C     Subroutine DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
C where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODES call sequence,
C YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
C EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
C
C If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
C (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
C in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the DVNORM
C routine (see below), and also used by DLSODES in the computation
C of the optional output IMXER, the diagonal Jacobian approximation,
C and the increments for difference quotient Jacobians.
C
C In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
C the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
C are available from the history array YH, described above under
C optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
C extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
C factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
C given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
C NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
C can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
C     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
C     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
C     NQ = ILS(33)
C     NST = ILS(34)
C     H = RLS(212)
C Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
C YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
C unnecessary when NST = 0).
C
C (b) DVNORM.
C The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
C root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
C     D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
C where
C   N = the length of the vector,
C   V = real array of length N containing the vector,
C   W = real array of length N containing weights,
C   D = SQRT( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
C DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
C EWT is as set by Subroutine DEWSET.
C
C If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
C value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSODES.
C None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
C For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
C   -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*W(i)) for the RMS-norm, or
C   -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
C    suppressing the error control on those components of y.

C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Other routines in the DLSODES package.
C
C In addition to Subroutine DLSODES, the DLSODES package includes the
C following subroutines and function routines:
C  DIPREP   acts as an iterface between DLSODES and DPREP, and also does
C           adjusting of work space pointers and work arrays.
C  DPREP    is called by DIPREP to compute sparsity and do sparse matrix
C           preprocessing if MITER = 1 or 2.
C  JGROUP   is called by DPREP to compute groups of Jacobian column
C           indices for use when MITER = 2.
C  ADJLR    adjusts the length of required sparse matrix work space.
C           It is called by DPREP.
C  CNTNZU   is called by DPREP and counts the nonzero elements in the
C           strict upper triangle of J + J-transpose, where J = df/dy.
C  DINTDY   computes an interpolated value of the y vector at t = TOUT.
C  DSTODE   is the core integrator, which does one step of the
C           integration and the associated error control.
C  DCFODE   sets all method coefficients and test constants.
C  DPRJS    computes and preprocesses the Jacobian matrix J = df/dy
C           and the Newton iteration matrix P = I - h*l0*J.
C  DSOLSS   manages solution of linear system in chord iteration.
C  DEWSET   sets the error weight vector EWT before each step.
C  DVNORM   computes the weighted RMS-norm of a vector.
C  DSRCMS   is a user-callable routine to save and restore
C           the contents of the internal Common blocks.
C  ODRV     constructs a reordering of the rows and columns of
C           a matrix by the minimum degree algorithm.  ODRV is a
C           driver routine which calls Subroutines MD, MDI, MDM,
C           MDP, MDU, and SRO.  See Ref. 2 for details.  (The ODRV
C           module has been modified since Ref. 2, however.)
C  CDRV     performs reordering, symbolic factorization, numerical
C           factorization, or linear system solution operations,
C           depending on a path argument ipath.  CDRV is a
C           driver routine which calls Subroutines NROC, NSFC,
C           NNFC, NNSC, and NNTC.  See Ref. 3 for details.
C           DLSODES uses CDRV to solve linear systems in which the
C           coefficient matrix is  P = I - con*J, where I is the
C           identity, con is a scalar, and J is an approximation to
C           the Jacobian df/dy.  Because CDRV deals with rowwise
C           sparsity descriptions, CDRV works with P-transpose, not P.
C  DUMACH   computes the unit roundoff in a machine-independent manner.
C  XERRWD, XSETUN, XSETF, IXSAV, and IUMACH  handle the printing of all
C           error messages and warnings.  XERRWD is machine-dependent.
C Note:  DVNORM, DUMACH, IXSAV, and IUMACH are function routines.
C All the others are subroutines.

C If MITER = 1 or 2, the required length of the matrix work space WM
C is not yet known, and so a crude minimum value is used for the
C initial tests of LRW and LIW, and YH is temporarily stored as far
C to the right in RWORK as possible, to leave the maximum amount
C of space for WM for matrix preprocessing.  Thus if MITER = 1 or 2
C and MOSS .ne. 2, some of the segments of RWORK are temporarily
C omitted, as they are not needed in the preprocessing.  These
C omitted segments are: ACOR if ISTATE = 1, EWT and ACOR if ISTATE = 3
C and MOSS = 1, and SAVF, EWT, and ACOR if ISTATE = 3 and MOSS = 0.

C This is the 12 November 2003 version of
C DLSODA: Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations, with
C         Automatic method switching for stiff and nonstiff problems.
C
C This version is in double precision.
C
C DLSODA solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
C systems of first order ODEs,
C     dy/dt = f(t,y) ,  or, in component form,
C     dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ)) (i = 1,...,NEQ).
C
C This a variant version of the DLSODE package.
C It switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff methods.
C This means that the user does not have to determine whether the
C problem is stiff or not, and the solver will automatically choose the
C appropriate method.  It always starts with the nonstiff method.

C Summary of Usage.
C
C Communication between the user and the DLSODA package, for normal
C situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
C of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
C details, including alternative treatment of the Jacobian matrix,
C optional inputs and outputs, nonstandard options, and
C instructions for special situations.  See also the example
C problem (with program and output) following this summary.
C
C A. First provide a subroutine of the form:
C               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
C which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with f(i).
C
C B. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODA once for
C each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
C for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
C by DLSODA.  On the first call to DLSODA, supply arguments as follows:
C F      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
C          This name must be declared External in calling program.
C NEQ    = number of first order ODEs.
C Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
C T      = the initial value of the independent variable.
C TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
C ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
C RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
C ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
C          the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
C          to be less than
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
C          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
C          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
C          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
C          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
C          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
C          control.  Caution: actual (global) errors may exceed these
C          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
C ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
C ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1.
C IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
C RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
C             22 + NEQ * MAX(16, NEQ + 9).
C          See also Paragraph E below.
C LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
C IWORK  = integer work array of length at least  20 + NEQ.
C LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension).
C JAC    = name of subroutine for Jacobian matrix.
C          Use a dummy name.  See also Paragraph E below.
C JT     = Jacobian type indicator.  Set JT = 2.
C          See also Paragraph E below.
C Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, RWORK, IWORK,
C and possibly ATOL.
C
C C. The output from the first call (or any call) is:
C      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
C      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
C ISTATE = 2  if DLSODA was successful, negative otherwise.
C          -1 means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong JT).
C          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
C          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
C          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
C          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian
C             supplied or wrong choice of JT or tolerances).
C          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
C             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
C          -7 means work space insufficient to finish (see messages).
C
C D. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
C reset TOUT and call DLSODA again.  No other parameters need be reset.
C
C E. Note: If and when DLSODA regards the problem as stiff, and
C switches methods accordingly, it must make use of the NEQ by NEQ
C Jacobian matrix, J = df/dy.  For the sake of simplicity, the
C inputs to DLSODA recommended in Paragraph B above cause DLSODA to
C treat J as a full matrix, and to approximate it internally by
C difference quotients.  Alternatively, J can be treated as a band
C matrix (with great potential reduction in the size of the RWORK
C array).  Also, in either the full or banded case, the user can supply
C J in closed form, with a routine whose name is passed as the JAC
C argument.  These alternatives are described in the paragraphs on
C RWORK, JAC, and JT in the full description of the call sequence below.

C Example Problem.
C
C The following is a simple example problem, with the coding
C needed for its solution by DLSODA.  The problem is from chemical
C kinetics, and consists of the following three rate equations:
C     dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.e4*y2*y3
C     dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.e4*y2*y3 - 3.e7*y2**2
C     dy3/dt = 3.e7*y2**2
C on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.e10, with initial conditions
C y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0.  The problem is stiff.
C
C The following coding solves this problem with DLSODA,
C printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.e10.  It uses
C ITOL = 2 and ATOL much smaller for y2 than y1 or y3 because
C y2 has much smaller values.

C Full description of user interface to DLSODA.
C
C The user interface to DLSODA consists of the following parts.
C
C 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODA, which is a driver
C      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
C      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
C      following these descriptions is a description of
C      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
C      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
C
C 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODA package that may be
C      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
C      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
C      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
C
C 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
C      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
C      of the problem and continued solution later.
C
C 4.   Description of a subroutine in the DLSODA package,
C      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
C      this relates to the measurement of errors.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 1.  Call Sequence.
C
C The call sequence parameters used for input only are
C     F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, JT,
C and those used for both input and output are
C     Y, T, ISTATE.
C The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
C optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
C to the return from Subroutine DLSODA to the user's calling program.)
C
C The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
C initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
C change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
C
C The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
C
C F      = the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the
C          ODE system.  The system must be put in the first-order
C          form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function
C          of the scalar t and the vector y.  Subroutine F is to
C          compute the function f.  It is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
C          where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT = f(t,y)
C          is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
C          Subroutine F should not alter Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).
C          F must be declared External in the calling program.
C
C          Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
C
C          If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
C          externally to DLSODA, an extra call to F should be made
C          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
C          If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY instead.
C
C NEQ    = the size of the ODE system (number of first order
C          ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
C          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
C          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
C          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
C          these are to be accessed in F and/or JAC.
C
C          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
C          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
C          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
C          (The DLSODA package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
C          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
C          to F and JAC.  Hence, if it is an array, locations
C          NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data and pass
C          it to F and/or JAC.  Subroutines F and/or JAC must include
C          NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
C
C Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
C          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
C          first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on other calls.
C          On the first call, Y must contain the vector of initial
C          values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution vector,
C          evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
C          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
C
C          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to
C          F and JAC.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ, and locations
C          Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real data and
C          pass it to F and/or JAC.  (The DLSODA package accesses only
C          Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).)
C
C T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
C          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
C          on output, after each call, T is the value at which a
C          computed solution Y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
C          on an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
C
C TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
C          Used only for input.
C
C          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
C          to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next call.
C          For the initial t, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is used
C          in order to determine the direction of the integration
C          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
C          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
C          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
C
C          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
C          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
C          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
C
C          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
C          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
C          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
C          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
C          TCUR and HU).
C
C ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
C          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
C
C RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
C          Input only.
C
C ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
C
C             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
C          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
C          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
C          in y, according to an inequality of the form
C                      max-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
C          where EWT = (EWT(i)) is a vector of positive error weights.
C          The values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
C          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
C          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
C
C             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
C              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              4     array      array      RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C
C          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
C          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
C
C          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
C          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
C          error controls can be obtained by substituting a
C          user-supplied routine for the setting of EWT.
C          See Part 4 below.
C
C          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
C          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
C          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
C          down uniformly.
C
C ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
C          Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
C          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
C          2  means take one step only and return.
C          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
C             beyond t = TOUT and return.
C          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
C             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
C             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
C             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
C          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
C
C          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
C          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
C          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
C          in which case answers at t = TOUT are returned first).
C
C ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
C          the state of the calculation.
C
C          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
C          1  means this is the first call for the problem
C             (initializations will be done).  See note below.
C          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
C             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
C             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
C             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
C             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
C             tested for legality.)
C          3  means this is not the first call, and the
C             calculation is to continue normally, but with
C             a change in input parameters other than
C             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
C             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JT, ML, MU,
C             and any optional inputs except H0, MXORDN, and MXORDS.
C             (See IWORK description for ML and MU.)
C          Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
C          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
C          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
C          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
C          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
C          ISTATE = 1 on input.
C
C          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
C           1  means nothing was done; TOUT = T and ISTATE = 1 on input.
C           2  means the integration was performed successfully.
C          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
C              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
C              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
C              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
C              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
C              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
C              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
C              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
C              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
C          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
C              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
C              completing the requested task, but the integration
C              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
C              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
C              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
C              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
C              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
C              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
C          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
C              integration steps.  See written message for details.
C              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
C              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
C              the run to stop.
C          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
C              may be inappropriate.
C          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix,
C              if one is being used.
C          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
C              integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0)
C              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
C              The integration was successful as far as T.
C          -7  means the length of RWORK and/or IWORK was too small to
C              proceed, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              This happens when DLSODA chooses to switch methods
C              but LRW and/or LIW is too small for the new method.
C
C          Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
C          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
C          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
C          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
C          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
C          calling the solver again.
C
C IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
C          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
C          The optional inputs are listed separately below.
C          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
C                   default values will be used in all cases.
C          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
C
C RWORK  = a real array (double precision) for work space, and (in the
C          first 20 words) for conditional and optional inputs and
C          optional outputs.
C          As DLSODA switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff
C          methods, the required length of RWORK can change during the
C          problem.  Thus the RWORK array passed to DLSODA can either
C          have a static (fixed) length large enough for both methods,
C          or have a dynamic (changing) length altered by the calling
C          program in response to output from DLSODA.
C
C                       --- Fixed Length Case ---
C          If the RWORK length is to be fixed, it should be at least
C               MAX (LRN, LRS),
C          where LRN and LRS are the RWORK lengths required when the
C          current method is nonstiff or stiff, respectively.
C
C          The separate RWORK length requirements LRN and LRS are
C          as follows:
C          IF NEQ is constant and the maximum method orders have
C          their default values, then
C             LRN = 20 + 16*NEQ,
C             LRS = 22 + 9*NEQ + NEQ**2           if JT = 1 or 2,
C             LRS = 22 + 10*NEQ + (2*ML+MU)*NEQ   if JT = 4 or 5.
C          Under any other conditions, LRN and LRS are given by:
C             LRN = 20 + NYH*(MXORDN+1) + 3*NEQ,
C             LRS = 20 + NYH*(MXORDS+1) + 3*NEQ + LMAT,
C          where
C             NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
C             MXORDN = 12, unless a smaller value is given as an
C                      optional input,
C             MXORDS = 5, unless a smaller value is given as an
C                      optional input,
C             LMAT   = length of matrix work space:
C             LMAT   = NEQ**2 + 2              if JT = 1 or 2,
C             LMAT   = (2*ML + MU + 1)*NEQ + 2 if JT = 4 or 5.
C
C                       --- Dynamic Length Case ---
C          If the length of RWORK is to be dynamic, then it should
C          be at least LRN or LRS, as defined above, depending on the
C          current method.  Initially, it must be at least LRN (since
C          DLSODA starts with the nonstiff method).  On any return
C          from DLSODA, the optional output MCUR indicates the current
C          method.  If MCUR differs from the value it had on the
C          previous return, or if there has only been one call to
C          DLSODA and MCUR is now 2, then DLSODA has switched
C          methods during the last call, and the length of RWORK
C          should be reset (to LRN if MCUR = 1, or to LRS if
C          MCUR = 2).  (An increase in the RWORK length is required
C          if DLSODA returned ISTATE = -7, but not otherwise.)
C          After resetting the length, call DLSODA with ISTATE = 3
C          to signal that change.
C
C LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C IWORK  = an integer array for work space.
C          As DLSODA switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff
C          methods, the required length of IWORK can change during
C          problem, between
C             LIS = 20 + NEQ   and   LIN = 20,
C          respectively.  Thus the IWORK array passed to DLSODA can
C          either have a fixed length of at least 20 + NEQ, or have a
C          dynamic length of at least LIN or LIS, depending on the
C          current method.  The comments on dynamic length under
C          RWORK above apply here.  Initially, this length need
C          only be at least LIN = 20.
C
C          The first few words of IWORK are used for conditional and
C          optional inputs and optional outputs.
C
C          The following 2 words in IWORK are conditional inputs:
C            IWORK(1) = ML     these are the lower and upper
C            IWORK(2) = MU     half-bandwidths, respectively, of the
C                       banded Jacobian, excluding the main diagonal.
C                       The band is defined by the matrix locations
C                       (i,j) with i-ML .le. j .le. i+MU.  ML and MU
C                       must satisfy  0 .le.  ML,MU  .le. NEQ-1.
C                       These are required if JT is 4 or 5, and
C                       ignored otherwise.  ML and MU may in fact be
C                       the band parameters for a matrix to which
C                       df/dy is only approximately equal.
C
C LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C Note: The base addresses of the work arrays must not be
C altered between calls to DLSODA for the same problem.
C The contents of the work arrays must not be altered
C between calls, except possibly for the conditional and
C optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
C The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
C available for use by the user outside DLSODA between calls, if
C desired (but not for use by F or JAC).
C
C JAC    = the name of the user-supplied routine to compute the
C          Jacobian matrix, df/dy, if JT = 1 or 4.  The JAC routine
C          is optional, but if the problem is expected to be stiff much
C          of the time, you are encouraged to supply JAC, for the sake
C          of efficiency.  (Alternatively, set JT = 2 or 5 to have
C          DLSODA compute df/dy internally by difference quotients.)
C          If and when DLSODA uses df/dy, it treats this NEQ by NEQ
C          matrix either as full (JT = 1 or 2), or as banded (JT =
C          4 or 5) with half-bandwidths ML and MU (discussed under
C          IWORK above).  In either case, if JT = 1 or 4, the JAC
C          routine must compute df/dy as a function of the scalar t
C          and the vector y.  It is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, PD, NROWPD)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), PD(NROWPD,*)
C          where NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, and NROWPD are input and the array
C          PD is to be loaded with partial derivatives (elements of
C          the Jacobian matrix) on output.  PD must be given a first
C          dimension of NROWPD.  T and Y have the same meaning as in
C          Subroutine F.
C               In the full matrix case (JT = 1), ML and MU are
C          ignored, and the Jacobian is to be loaded into PD in
C          columnwise manner, with df(i)/dy(j) loaded into PD(i,j).
C               In the band matrix case (JT = 4), the elements
C          within the band are to be loaded into PD in columnwise
C          manner, with diagonal lines of df/dy loaded into the rows
C          of PD.  Thus df(i)/dy(j) is to be loaded into PD(i-j+MU+1,j).
C          ML and MU are the half-bandwidth parameters (see IWORK).
C          The locations in PD in the two triangular areas which
C          correspond to nonexistent matrix elements can be ignored
C          or loaded arbitrarily, as they are overwritten by DLSODA.
C               JAC need not provide df/dy exactly.  A crude
C          approximation (possibly with a smaller bandwidth) will do.
C               In either case, PD is preset to zero by the solver,
C          so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
C          Each call to JAC is preceded by a call to F with the same
C          arguments NEQ, T, and Y.  Thus to gain some efficiency,
C          intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be
C          saved in a user Common block by F and not recomputed by JAC,
C          if desired.  Also, JAC may alter the Y array, if desired.
C          JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
C               Subroutine JAC may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in JAC) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
C
C JT     = Jacobian type indicator.  Used only for input.
C          JT specifies how the Jacobian matrix df/dy will be
C          treated, if and when DLSODA requires this matrix.
C          JT has the following values and meanings:
C           1 means a user-supplied full (NEQ by NEQ) Jacobian.
C           2 means an internally generated (difference quotient) full
C             Jacobian (using NEQ extra calls to F per df/dy value).
C           4 means a user-supplied banded Jacobian.
C           5 means an internally generated banded Jacobian (using
C             ML+MU+1 extra calls to F per df/dy evaluation).
C          If JT = 1 or 4, the user must supply a Subroutine JAC
C          (the name is arbitrary) as described above under JAC.
C          If JT = 2 or 5, a dummy argument can be used.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Inputs.
C
C The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
C call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
C this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
C location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
C The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
C case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
C of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
C Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
C locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
C then set those of interest to nonzero values.
C
C Name    Location      Meaning and Default Value
C
C H0      RWORK(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
C                   The default value is determined by the solver.
C
C HMAX    RWORK(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is infinite.
C
C HMIN    RWORK(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
C                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
C                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
C
C IXPR    IWORK(5)  flag to generate extra printing at method switches.
C                   IXPR = 0 means no extra printing (the default).
C                   IXPR = 1 means print data on each switch.
C                   T, H, and NST will be printed on the same logical
C                   unit as used for error messages.
C
C MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
C                   allowed during one call to the solver.
C                   The default value is 500.
C
C MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
C                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
C                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
C                   value.  The default value is 10.
C
C MXORDN  IWORK(8)  the maximum order to be allowed for the nonstiff
C                   (Adams) method.  the default value is 12.
C                   if MXORDN exceeds the default value, it will
C                   be reduced to the default value.
C                   MXORDN is held constant during the problem.
C
C MXORDS  IWORK(9)  the maximum order to be allowed for the stiff
C                   (BDF) method.  The default value is 5.
C                   If MXORDS exceeds the default value, it will
C                   be reduced to the default value.
C                   MXORDS is held constant during the problem.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Outputs.
C
C As optional additional output from DLSODA, the variables listed
C below are quantities related to the performance of DLSODA
C which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
C the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
C except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
C on any successful return from DLSODA, and on any return with
C ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, or -6.  On an illegal input return
C (ISTATE = -3), they will be unchanged from their existing values
C (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
C On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
C as noted below.
C
C Name    Location      Meaning
C
C HU      RWORK(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
C
C HCUR    RWORK(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
C
C TCUR    RWORK(13) the current value of the independent variable
C                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
C                   current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
C                   will always be at least as far as the argument
C                   T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
C
C TOLSF   RWORK(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
C                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
C                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
C                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
C                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
C                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
C                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
C                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
C                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
C
C TSW     RWORK(15) the value of t at the time of the last method
C                   switch, if any.
C
C NST     IWORK(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
C
C NFE     IWORK(12) the number of f evaluations for the problem so far.
C
C NJE     IWORK(13) the number of Jacobian evaluations (and of matrix
C                   LU decompositions) for the problem so far.
C
C NQU     IWORK(14) the method order last used (successfully).
C
C NQCUR   IWORK(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.
C
C IMXER   IWORK(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
C                   the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
C                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
C
C LENRW   IWORK(17) the length of RWORK actually required, assuming
C                   that the length of RWORK is to be fixed for the
C                   rest of the problem, and that switching may occur.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C LENIW   IWORK(18) the length of IWORK actually required, assuming
C                   that the length of IWORK is to be fixed for the
C                   rest of the problem, and that switching may occur.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C MUSED   IWORK(19) the method indicator for the last successful step:
C                   1 means Adams (nonstiff), 2 means BDF (stiff).
C
C MCUR    IWORK(20) the current method indicator:
C                   1 means Adams (nonstiff), 2 means BDF (stiff).
C                   This is the method to be attempted
C                   on the next step.  Thus it differs from MUSED
C                   only if a method switch has just been made.
C
C The following two arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
C may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
C For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
C its base address in RWORK, and its description.
C
C Name    Base Address      Description
C
C YH      21             the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
C                        (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
C                        of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
C                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
C                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
C                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
C                        evaluated at T = TCUR.
C
C ACOR     LACOR         array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
C         (from Common   corrections on each step, scaled on output
C           as noted)    to represent the estimated local error in y
C                        on the last step.  This is the vector E in
C                        the description of the error control.  It is
C                        defined only on a successful return from
C                        DLSODA.  The base address LACOR is obtained by
C                        including in the user's program the
C                        following 2 lines:
C                           COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218), ILS(37)
C                           LACOR = ILS(22)

C Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.
C
C The following are optional calls which the user may make to
C gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSODA.
C (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
C SLATEC error handling package.)
C
C     Form of Call                  Function
C   CALL XSETUN(LUN)          set the logical unit number, LUN, for
C                             output of messages from DLSODA, if
C                             the default is not desired.
C                             The default value of LUN is 6.
C
C   CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         set a flag to control the printing of
C                             messages by DLSODA.
C                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger:
C                             This risks losing valuable information.)
C                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).
C
C                             Either of the above calls may be made at
C                             any time and will take effect immediately.
C
C   CALL DSRCMA(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) saves and restores the contents of
C                             the internal Common blocks used by
C                             DLSODA (see Part 3 below).
C                             RSAV must be a real array of length 240
C                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
C                             array of length 46 or more.
C                             JOB=1 means save Common into RSAV/ISAV.
C                             JOB=2 means restore Common from RSAV/ISAV.
C                                DSRCMA is useful if one is
C                             interrupting a run and restarting
C                             later, or alternating between two or
C                             more problems solved with DLSODA.
C
C   CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        provide derivatives of y, of various
C        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
C                             desired.  It may be called only after
C                             a successful return from DLSODA.
C
C The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.
C The form of the call is:
C
C   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(21), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
C
C The input parameters are:
C
C T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
C             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODA).
C             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
C             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
C K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
C             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
C             (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
C             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(T), is already provided
C             by DLSODA directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
C             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
C RWORK(21) = the base address of the history array YH.
C NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
C
C The output parameters are:
C
C DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
C             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
C IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
C             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
C             On an error return, a message is also written.

C Part 3.  Common Blocks.
C
C If DLSODA is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
C must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
C   (1) the call sequence to DLSODA, and
C   (2) the two internal Common blocks
C         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
C                      followed by 37 integer words),
C         /DLSA01/  of length  31    (22 double precision words
C                      followed by  9 integer words).
C
C If DLSODA is used on a system in which the contents of internal
C Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
C declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure
C that their contents are preserved.
C
C If the solution of a given problem by DLSODA is to be interrupted
C and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
C or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
C following the return from the last DLSODA call prior to the
C interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
C internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
C next DLSODA call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
C blocks, use Subroutine DSRCMA (see Part 2 above).
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
C
C Below is a description of a routine in the DLSODA package which
C relates to the measurement of errors, and can be
C replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
C a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
C done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
C (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
C superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
C
C (a) DEWSET.
C The following subroutine is called just before each internal
C integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
C described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
C     Subroutine DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
C where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODA call sequence,
C YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
C EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
C
C If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
C (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
C in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the
C DMNORM routine, and also used by DLSODA in the computation
C of the optional output IMXER, and the increments for difference
C quotient Jacobians.
C
C In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
C the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
C are available from the history array YH, described above under
C optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
C extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
C factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
C given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
C NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
C can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
C     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
C     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
C     NQ = ILS(33)
C     NST = ILS(34)
C     H = RLS(212)
C Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
C YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
C unnecessary when NST = 0).

C This is the 12 November 2003 version of
C DLSODAR: Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations, with
C          Automatic method switching for stiff and nonstiff problems,
C          and with Root-finding.
C
C This version is in double precision.
C
C DLSODAR solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
C systems of first order ODEs,
C     dy/dt = f(t,y) ,  or, in component form,
C     dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ)) (i = 1,...,NEQ).
C At the same time, it locates the roots of any of a set of functions
C     g(i) = g(i,t,y(1),...,y(NEQ))  (i = 1,...,ng).
C
C This a variant version of the DLSODE package.  It differs from it
C in two ways:
C (a) It switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff methods.
C This means that the user does not have to determine whether the
C problem is stiff or not, and the solver will automatically choose the
C appropriate method.  It always starts with the nonstiff method.
C (b) It finds the root of at least one of a set of constraint
C functions g(i) of the independent and dependent variables.
C It finds only those roots for which some g(i), as a function
C of t, changes sign in the interval of integration.
C It then returns the solution at the root, if that occurs
C sooner than the specified stop condition, and otherwise returns
C the solution according the specified stop condition.

C Summary of Usage.
C
C Communication between the user and the DLSODAR package, for normal
C situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
C of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
C details, including alternative treatment of the Jacobian matrix,
C optional inputs and outputs, nonstandard options, and
C instructions for special situations.  See also the example
C problem (with program and output) following this summary.
C
C A. First provide a subroutine of the form:
C               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
C which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with f(i).
C
C B. Provide a subroutine of the form:
C               SUBROUTINE G (NEQ, T, Y, NG, GOUT)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), GOUT(NG)
C which supplies the vector function g by loading GOUT(i) with
C g(i), the i-th constraint function whose root is sought.
C
C C. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODAR once for
C each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
C for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages by
C DLSODAR.  On the first call to DLSODAR, supply arguments as follows:
C F      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
C          This name must be declared External in calling program.
C NEQ    = number of first order ODEs.
C Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
C T      = the initial value of the independent variable.
C TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
C ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
C RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
C ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
C          the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
C          to be less than
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
C          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
C          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
C          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
C          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
C          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
C          control.  Caution: actual (global) errors may exceed these
C          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
C ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
C ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1.
C IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
C RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
C             22 + NEQ * MAX(16, NEQ + 9) + 3*NG.
C          See also Paragraph F below.
C LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
C IWORK  = integer work array of length at least  20 + NEQ.
C LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension).
C JAC    = name of subroutine for Jacobian matrix.
C          Use a dummy name.  See also Paragraph F below.
C JT     = Jacobian type indicator.  Set JT = 2.
C          See also Paragraph F below.
C G      = name of subroutine for constraint functions, whose
C          roots are desired during the integration.
C          This name must be declared External in calling program.
C NG     = number of constraint functions g(i).  If there are none,
C          set NG = 0, and pass a dummy name for G.
C JROOT  = integer array of length NG for output of root information.
C          See next paragraph.
C Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, RWORK, IWORK,
C JROOT, and possibly ATOL.
C
C D. The output from the first call (or any call) is:
C      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
C      T = corresponding value of independent variable.  This is
C          TOUT if ISTATE = 2, or the root location if ISTATE = 3,
C          or the farthest point reached if DLSODAR was unsuccessful.
C ISTATE = 2 or 3  if DLSODAR was successful, negative otherwise.
C           2 means no root was found, and TOUT was reached as desired.
C           3 means a root was found prior to reaching TOUT.
C          -1 means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong JT).
C          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
C          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
C          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
C          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian
C             supplied or wrong choice of JT or tolerances).
C          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
C             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
C          -7 means work space insufficient to finish (see messages).
C JROOT  = array showing roots found if ISTATE = 3 on return.
C          JROOT(i) = 1 if g(i) has a root at t, or 0 otherwise.
C
C E. To continue the integration after a successful return, proceed
C as follows:
C  (a) If ISTATE = 2 on return, reset TOUT and call DLSODAR again.
C  (b) If ISTATE = 3 on return, reset ISTATE to 2, call DLSODAR again.
C In either case, no other parameters need be reset.
C
C F. Note: If and when DLSODAR regards the problem as stiff, and
C switches methods accordingly, it must make use of the NEQ by NEQ
C Jacobian matrix, J = df/dy.  For the sake of simplicity, the
C inputs to DLSODAR recommended in Paragraph C above cause DLSODAR to
C treat J as a full matrix, and to approximate it internally by
C difference quotients.  Alternatively, J can be treated as a band
C matrix (with great potential reduction in the size of the RWORK
C array).  Also, in either the full or banded case, the user can supply
C J in closed form, with a routine whose name is passed as the JAC
C argument.  These alternatives are described in the paragraphs on
C RWORK, JAC, and JT in the full description of the call sequence below.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Example Problem.
C
C The following is a simple example problem, with the coding
C needed for its solution by DLSODAR.  The problem is from chemical
C kinetics, and consists of the following three rate equations:
C     dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.e4*y2*y3
C     dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.e4*y2*y3 - 3.e7*y2**2
C     dy3/dt = 3.e7*y2**2
C on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.e10, with initial conditions
C y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0.  The problem is stiff.
C In addition, we want to find the values of t, y1, y2, and y3 at which
C   (1) y1 reaches the value 1.e-4, and
C   (2) y3 reaches the value 1.e-2.
C
C The following coding solves this problem with DLSODAR,
C printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.e10, and at the computed
C roots.  It uses ITOL = 2 and ATOL much smaller for y2 than y1 or y3
C because y2 has much smaller values.
C At the end of the run, statistical quantities of interest are
C printed (see optional outputs in the full description below).

C Full Description of User Interface to DLSODAR.
C
C The user interface to DLSODAR consists of the following parts.
C
C 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODAR, which is a driver
C      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
C      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
C      Following these descriptions is a description of
C      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
C      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
C
C 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODAR package that may be
C      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
C      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
C      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
C
C 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
C      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
C      of the problem and continued solution later.
C
C 4.   Description of a subroutine in the DLSODAR package,
C      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
C      this relates to the measurement of errors.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 1.  Call Sequence.
C
C The call sequence parameters used for input only are
C     F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC,
C     JT, G, and NG,
C that used only for output is  JROOT,
C and those used for both input and output are
C     Y, T, ISTATE.
C The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
C optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
C to the return from Subroutine DLSODAR to the user's calling program.)
C
C The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
C initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
C change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
C
C The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
C
C F      = the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the
C          ODE system.  The system must be put in the first-order
C          form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function
C          of the scalar t and the vector y.  Subroutine F is to
C          compute the function f.  It is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
C          where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT = f(t,y)
C          is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
C          Subroutine F should not alter Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).
C          F must be declared External in the calling program.
C
C          Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
C
C          If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
C          externally to DLSODAR, an extra call to F should be made
C          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
C          If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY instead.
C
C NEQ    = the size of the ODE system (number of first order
C          ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
C          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
C          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
C          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
C          these are to be accessed in F and/or JAC.
C
C          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
C          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
C          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
C          (The DLSODAR package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
C          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
C          to F, JAC, and G.  Hence, if it is an array, locations
C          NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data and pass
C          it to F, JAC, and G.  Each such subroutine must include
C          NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
C
C Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
C          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
C          first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on other calls.
C          On the first call, Y must contain the vector of initial
C          values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution vector,
C          evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
C          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
C
C          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to F,
C          JAC, and G.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ, and locations
C          Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real data and
C          pass it to F, JAC, and G.  (The DLSODAR package accesses only
C          Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).)
C
C T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
C          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
C          On output, after each call, T is the value at which a
C          computed solution y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
C          If a root was found, T is the computed location of the
C          root reached first, on output.
C          On an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
C
C TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
C          Used only for input.
C
C          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
C          to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next call.
C          For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is used
C          in order to determine the direction of the integration
C          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
C          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
C          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
C
C          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
C          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
C          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
C
C          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
C          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
C          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
C          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
C          TCUR and HU).
C
C ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
C          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
C
C RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
C          Input only.
C
C ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
C
C             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
C          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
C          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
C          in y, according to an inequality of the form
C                      max-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
C          where EWT = (EWT(i)) is a vector of positive error weights.
C          The values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
C          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
C          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
C
C             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
C              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              4     array      array      RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C
C          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
C          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
C
C          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
C          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
C          error controls can be obtained by substituting a
C          user-supplied routine for the setting of EWT.
C          See Part 4 below.
C
C          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
C          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
C          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
C          down uniformly.
C
C ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
C          input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
C          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
C          2  means take one step only and return.
C          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
C             beyond t = TOUT and return.
C          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
C             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
C             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
C             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
C          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
C
C          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
C          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
C          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
C          in which case answers at t = TOUT are returned first).
C
C ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
C          the state of the calculation.
C
C          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
C          1  means this is the first call for the problem
C             (initializations will be done).  See note below.
C          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
C             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
C             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
C             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
C             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
C             tested for legality.)
C          3  means this is not the first call, and the
C             calculation is to continue normally, but with
C             a change in input parameters other than
C             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
C             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JT, ML, MU,
C             and any optional inputs except H0, MXORDN, and MXORDS.
C             (See IWORK description for ML and MU.)
C             In addition, immediately following a return with
C             ISTATE = 3 (root found), NG and G may be changed.
C             (But changing NG from 0 to .gt. 0 is not allowed.)
C          Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
C          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
C          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
C          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
C          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
C          ISTATE = 1 on input.
C
C          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
C           1  means nothing was done; TOUT = t and ISTATE = 1 on input.
C           2  means the integration was performed successfully, and
C              no roots were found.
C           3  means the integration was successful, and one or more
C              roots were found before satisfying the stop condition
C              specified by ITASK.  See JROOT.
C          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
C              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
C              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
C              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
C              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
C              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
C              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
C              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
C              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
C          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
C              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
C              completing the requested task, but the integration
C              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
C              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
C              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
C              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
C              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
C              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
C          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
C              integration steps.  See written message for details.
C              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
C              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
C              the run to stop.
C          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
C              may be inappropriate.
C          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix,
C              if one is being used.
C          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
C              integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0)
C              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
C              The integration was successful as far as T.
C          -7  means the length of RWORK and/or IWORK was too small to
C              proceed, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              This happens when DLSODAR chooses to switch methods
C              but LRW and/or LIW is too small for the new method.
C
C          Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
C          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
C          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
C          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
C          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
C          calling the solver again.
C
C IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
C          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
C          The optional inputs are listed separately below.
C          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
C                   Default values will be used in all cases.
C          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
C
C RWORK  = a real array (double precision) for work space, and (in the
C          first 20 words) for conditional and optional inputs and
C          optional outputs.
C          As DLSODAR switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff
C          methods, the required length of RWORK can change during the
C          problem.  Thus the RWORK array passed to DLSODAR can either
C          have a static (fixed) length large enough for both methods,
C          or have a dynamic (changing) length altered by the calling
C          program in response to output from DLSODAR.
C
C                       --- Fixed Length Case ---
C          If the RWORK length is to be fixed, it should be at least
C               max (LRN, LRS),
C          where LRN and LRS are the RWORK lengths required when the
C          current method is nonstiff or stiff, respectively.
C
C          The separate RWORK length requirements LRN and LRS are
C          as follows:
C          If NEQ is constant and the maximum method orders have
C          their default values, then
C             LRN = 20 + 16*NEQ + 3*NG,
C             LRS = 22 + 9*NEQ + NEQ**2 + 3*NG           (JT = 1 or 2),
C             LRS = 22 + 10*NEQ + (2*ML+MU)*NEQ + 3*NG   (JT = 4 or 5).
C          Under any other conditions, LRN and LRS are given by:
C             LRN = 20 + NYH*(MXORDN+1) + 3*NEQ + 3*NG,
C             LRS = 20 + NYH*(MXORDS+1) + 3*NEQ + LMAT + 3*NG,
C          where
C             NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
C             MXORDN = 12, unless a smaller value is given as an
C                      optional input,
C             MXORDS = 5, unless a smaller value is given as an
C                      optional input,
C             LMAT   = length of matrix work space:
C             LMAT   = NEQ**2 + 2              if JT = 1 or 2,
C             LMAT   = (2*ML + MU + 1)*NEQ + 2 if JT = 4 or 5.
C
C                       --- Dynamic Length Case ---
C          If the length of RWORK is to be dynamic, then it should
C          be at least LRN or LRS, as defined above, depending on the
C          current method.  Initially, it must be at least LRN (since
C          DLSODAR starts with the nonstiff method).  On any return
C          from DLSODAR, the optional output MCUR indicates the current
C          method.  If MCUR differs from the value it had on the
C          previous return, or if there has only been one call to
C          DLSODAR and MCUR is now 2, then DLSODAR has switched
C          methods during the last call, and the length of RWORK
C          should be reset (to LRN if MCUR = 1, or to LRS if
C          MCUR = 2).  (An increase in the RWORK length is required
C          if DLSODAR returned ISTATE = -7, but not otherwise.)
C          After resetting the length, call DLSODAR with ISTATE = 3
C          to signal that change.
C
C LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C IWORK  = an integer array for work space.
C          As DLSODAR switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff
C          methods, the required length of IWORK can change during
C          problem, between
C             LIS = 20 + NEQ   and   LIN = 20,
C          respectively.  Thus the IWORK array passed to DLSODAR can
C          either have a fixed length of at least 20 + NEQ, or have a
C          dynamic length of at least LIN or LIS, depending on the
C          current method.  The comments on dynamic length under
C          RWORK above apply here.  Initially, this length need
C          only be at least LIN = 20.
C
C          The first few words of IWORK are used for conditional and
C          optional inputs and optional outputs.
C
C          The following 2 words in IWORK are conditional inputs:
C            IWORK(1) = ML     These are the lower and upper
C            IWORK(2) = MU     half-bandwidths, respectively, of the
C                       banded Jacobian, excluding the main diagonal.
C                       The band is defined by the matrix locations
C                       (i,j) with i-ML .le. j .le. i+MU.  ML and MU
C                       must satisfy  0 .le.  ML,MU  .le. NEQ-1.
C                       These are required if JT is 4 or 5, and
C                       ignored otherwise.  ML and MU may in fact be
C                       the band parameters for a matrix to which
C                       df/dy is only approximately equal.
C
C LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C Note: The base addresses of the work arrays must not be
C altered between calls to DLSODAR for the same problem.
C The contents of the work arrays must not be altered
C between calls, except possibly for the conditional and
C optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
C The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
C available for use by the user outside DLSODAR between calls, if
C desired (but not for use by F, JAC, or G).
C
C JAC    = the name of the user-supplied routine to compute the
C          Jacobian matrix, df/dy, if JT = 1 or 4.  The JAC routine
C          is optional, but if the problem is expected to be stiff much
C          of the time, you are encouraged to supply JAC, for the sake
C          of efficiency.  (Alternatively, set JT = 2 or 5 to have
C          DLSODAR compute df/dy internally by difference quotients.)
C          If and when DLSODAR uses df/dy, it treats this NEQ by NEQ
C          matrix either as full (JT = 1 or 2), or as banded (JT =
C          4 or 5) with half-bandwidths ML and MU (discussed under
C          IWORK above).  In either case, if JT = 1 or 4, the JAC
C          routine must compute df/dy as a function of the scalar t
C          and the vector y.  It is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, PD, NROWPD)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), PD(NROWPD,*)
C          where NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, and NROWPD are input and the array
C          PD is to be loaded with partial derivatives (elements of
C          the Jacobian matrix) on output.  PD must be given a first
C          dimension of NROWPD.  T and Y have the same meaning as in
C          Subroutine F.
C               In the full matrix case (JT = 1), ML and MU are
C          ignored, and the Jacobian is to be loaded into PD in
C          columnwise manner, with df(i)/dy(j) loaded into pd(i,j).
C               In the band matrix case (JT = 4), the elements
C          within the band are to be loaded into PD in columnwise
C          manner, with diagonal lines of df/dy loaded into the rows
C          of PD.  Thus df(i)/dy(j) is to be loaded into PD(i-j+MU+1,j).
C          ML and MU are the half-bandwidth parameters (see IWORK).
C          The locations in PD in the two triangular areas which
C          correspond to nonexistent matrix elements can be ignored
C          or loaded arbitrarily, as they are overwritten by DLSODAR.
C               JAC need not provide df/dy exactly.  A crude
C          approximation (possibly with a smaller bandwidth) will do.
C               In either case, PD is preset to zero by the solver,
C          so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
C          Each call to JAC is preceded by a call to F with the same
C          arguments NEQ, T, and Y.  Thus to gain some efficiency,
C          intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be
C          saved in a user Common block by F and not recomputed by JAC,
C          if desired.  Also, JAC may alter the Y array, if desired.
C          JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
C               Subroutine JAC may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in JAC) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
C
C JT     = Jacobian type indicator.  Used only for input.
C          JT specifies how the Jacobian matrix df/dy will be
C          treated, if and when DLSODAR requires this matrix.
C          JT has the following values and meanings:
C           1 means a user-supplied full (NEQ by NEQ) Jacobian.
C           2 means an internally generated (difference quotient) full
C             Jacobian (using NEQ extra calls to F per df/dy value).
C           4 means a user-supplied banded Jacobian.
C           5 means an internally generated banded Jacobian (using
C             ML+MU+1 extra calls to F per df/dy evaluation).
C          If JT = 1 or 4, the user must supply a Subroutine JAC
C          (the name is arbitrary) as described above under JAC.
C          If JT = 2 or 5, a dummy argument can be used.
C
C G      = the name of subroutine for constraint functions, whose
C          roots are desired during the integration.  It is to have
C          the form
C               SUBROUTINE G (NEQ, T, Y, NG, GOUT)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), GOUT(NG)
C          where NEQ, T, Y, and NG are input, and the array GOUT
C          is output.  NEQ, T, and Y have the same meaning as in
C          the F routine, and GOUT is an array of length NG.
C          For i = 1,...,NG, this routine is to load into GOUT(i)
C          the value at (T,Y) of the i-th constraint function g(i).
C          DLSODAR will find roots of the g(i) of odd multiplicity
C          (i.e. sign changes) as they occur during the integration.
C          G must be declared External in the calling program.
C
C          Caution:  Because of numerical errors in the functions
C          g(i) due to roundoff and integration error, DLSODAR may
C          return false roots, or return the same root at two or more
C          nearly equal values of t.  If such false roots are
C          suspected, the user should consider smaller error tolerances
C          and/or higher precision in the evaluation of the g(i).
C
C          If a root of some g(i) defines the end of the problem,
C          the input to DLSODAR should nevertheless allow integration
C          to a point slightly past that root, so that DLSODAR can
C          locate the root by interpolation.
C
C          Subroutine G may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in G) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
C
C NG     = number of constraint functions g(i).  If there are none,
C          set NG = 0, and pass a dummy name for G.
C
C JROOT  = integer array of length NG.  Used only for output.
C          On a return with ISTATE = 3 (one or more roots found),
C          JROOT(i) = 1 if g(i) has a root at T, or JROOT(i) = 0 if not.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Inputs.
C
C The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
C call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
C this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
C location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
C The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
C case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
C of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
C Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
C locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
C then set those of interest to nonzero values.
C
C Name    Location      Meaning and Default Value
C
C H0      RWORK(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
C                   The default value is determined by the solver.
C
C HMAX    RWORK(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is infinite.
C
C HMIN    RWORK(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
C                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
C                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
C
C IXPR    IWORK(5)  flag to generate extra printing at method switches.
C                   IXPR = 0 means no extra printing (the default).
C                   IXPR = 1 means print data on each switch.
C                   T, H, and NST will be printed on the same logical
C                   unit as used for error messages.
C
C MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
C                   allowed during one call to the solver.
C                   The default value is 500.
C
C MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
C                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
C                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
C                   value.  The default value is 10.
C
C MXORDN  IWORK(8)  the maximum order to be allowed for the nonstiff
C                   (Adams) method.  The default value is 12.
C                   If MXORDN exceeds the default value, it will
C                   be reduced to the default value.
C                   MXORDN is held constant during the problem.
C
C MXORDS  IWORK(9)  the maximum order to be allowed for the stiff
C                   (BDF) method.  The default value is 5.
C                   If MXORDS exceeds the default value, it will
C                   be reduced to the default value.
C                   MXORDS is held constant during the problem.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Outputs.
C
C As optional additional output from DLSODAR, the variables listed
C below are quantities related to the performance of DLSODAR
C which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
C the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
C Except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
C on any successful return from DLSODAR, and on any return with
C ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, or -6.  On an illegal input return
C (ISTATE = -3), they will be unchanged from their existing values
C (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
C On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
C as noted below.
C
C Name    Location      Meaning
C
C HU      RWORK(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
C
C HCUR    RWORK(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
C
C TCUR    RWORK(13) the current value of the independent variable
C                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
C                   current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
C                   will always be at least as far as the argument
C                   T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
C
C TOLSF   RWORK(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
C                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
C                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
C                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
C                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
C                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
C                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
C                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
C                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
C
C TSW     RWORK(15) the value of t at the time of the last method
C                   switch, if any.
C
C NGE     IWORK(10) the number of g evaluations for the problem so far.
C
C NST     IWORK(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
C
C NFE     IWORK(12) the number of f evaluations for the problem so far.
C
C NJE     IWORK(13) the number of Jacobian evaluations (and of matrix
C                   LU decompositions) for the problem so far.
C
C NQU     IWORK(14) the method order last used (successfully).
C
C NQCUR   IWORK(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.
C
C IMXER   IWORK(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
C                   the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
C                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
C
C LENRW   IWORK(17) the length of RWORK actually required, assuming
C                   that the length of RWORK is to be fixed for the
C                   rest of the problem, and that switching may occur.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C LENIW   IWORK(18) the length of IWORK actually required, assuming
C                   that the length of IWORK is to be fixed for the
C                   rest of the problem, and that switching may occur.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C MUSED   IWORK(19) the method indicator for the last successful step:
C                   1 means Adams (nonstiff), 2 means BDF (stiff).
C
C MCUR    IWORK(20) the current method indicator:
C                   1 means Adams (nonstiff), 2 means BDF (stiff).
C                   This is the method to be attempted
C                   on the next step.  Thus it differs from MUSED
C                   only if a method switch has just been made.
C
C The following two arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
C may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
C For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
C its base address in RWORK, and its description.
C
C Name    Base Address      Description
C
C YH      21 + 3*NG      the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
C                        (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
C                        of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
C                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
C                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
C                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
C                        evaluated at t = TCUR.
C
C ACOR     LACOR         array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
C         (from Common   corrections on each step, scaled on output
C           as noted)    to represent the estimated local error in y
C                        on the last step.  This is the vector E in
C                        the description of the error control.  It is
C                        defined only on a successful return from
C                        DLSODAR.  The base address LACOR is obtained by
C                        including in the user's program the
C                        following 2 lines:
C                           COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218), ILS(37)
C                           LACOR = ILS(22)
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.
C
C The following are optional calls which the user may make to
C gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSODAR.
C (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
C SLATEC error handling package.)
C
C     Form of Call                  Function
C   CALL XSETUN(LUN)          Set the logical unit number, LUN, for
C                             output of messages from DLSODAR, if
C                             the default is not desired.
C                             The default value of LUN is 6.
C
C   CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         Set a flag to control the printing of
C                             messages by DLSODAR.
C                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger:
C                             This risks losing valuable information.)
C                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).
C
C                             Either of the above calls may be made at
C                             any time and will take effect immediately.
C
C   CALL DSRCAR(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) saves and restores the contents of
C                             the internal Common blocks used by
C                             DLSODAR (see Part 3 below).
C                             RSAV must be a real array of length 245
C                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
C                             array of length 55 or more.
C                             JOB=1 means save Common into RSAV/ISAV.
C                             JOB=2 means restore Common from RSAV/ISAV.
C                                DSRCAR is useful if one is
C                             interrupting a run and restarting
C                             later, or alternating between two or
C                             more problems solved with DLSODAR.
C
C   CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        Provide derivatives of y, of various
C        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
C                             desired.  It may be called only after
C                             a successful return from DLSODAR.
C
C The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.
C The form of the call is:
C
C   LYH = 21 + 3*NG
C   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(LYH), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
C
C The input parameters are:
C
C T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
C             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODAR).
C             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
C             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
C K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
C             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
C             (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
C             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(t), is already provided
C             by DLSODAR directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
C             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
C LYH       = 21 + 3*NG = base address in RWORK of the history array YH.
C NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
C
C The output parameters are:
C
C DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
C             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
C IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
C             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
C             On an error return, a message is also written.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 3.  Common Blocks.
C
C If DLSODAR is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
C must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
C   (1) the call sequence to DLSODAR, and
C   (2) the three internal Common blocks
C         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
C                      followed by 37 integer words),
C         /DLSA01/  of length  31    (22 double precision words
C                      followed by  9 integer words).
C         /DLSR01/  of length   7  (3 double precision words
C                      followed by  4 integer words).
C
C If DLSODAR is used on a system in which the contents of internal
C Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
C declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure
C that their contents are preserved.
C
C If the solution of a given problem by DLSODAR is to be interrupted
C and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
C or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
C following the return from the last DLSODAR call prior to the
C interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
C internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
C next DLSODAR call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
C blocks, use Subroutine DSRCAR (see Part 2 above).
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
C
C Below is a description of a routine in the DLSODAR package which
C relates to the measurement of errors, and can be
C replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
C a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
C done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
C (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
C superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
C
C (a) DEWSET.
C The following subroutine is called just before each internal
C integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
C described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
C     Subroutine DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
C where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODAR call sequence,
C YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
C EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
C
C If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
C (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
C in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the
C DMNORM routine, and also used by DLSODAR in the computation
C of the optional output IMXER, and the increments for difference
C quotient Jacobians.
C
C In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
C the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
C are available from the history array YH, described above under
C optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
C extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
C factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
C given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
C NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
C can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
C     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
C     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
C     NQ = ILS(33)
C     NST = ILS(34)
C     H = RLS(212)
C Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
C YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
C unnecessary when NST = 0).

C This is the 18 November 2003 version of
C DLSODPK: Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential equations,
C          with Preconditioned Krylov iteration methods for the
C          Newton correction linear systems.
C
C This version is in double precision.
C
C DLSODPK solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
C systems of first order ODEs,
C     dy/dt = f(t,y) ,  or, in component form,
C     dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ)) (i = 1,...,NEQ).
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Introduction.
C
C This is a modification of the DLSODE package which incorporates
C various preconditioned Krylov subspace iteration methods for the
C linear algebraic systems that arise in the case of stiff systems.
C
C The linear systems that must be solved have the form
C   A * x  = b ,  where  A = identity - hl0 * (df/dy) .
C Here hl0 is a scalar, and df/dy is the Jacobian matrix of partial
C derivatives of f (NEQ by NEQ).
C
C The particular Krylov method is chosen by setting the second digit,
C MITER, in the method flag MF.
C Currently, the values of MITER have the following meanings:
C
C  MITER = 1 means the preconditioned Scaled Incomplete
C            Orthogonalization Method (SPIOM).
C
C          2 means an incomplete version of the Preconditioned Scaled
C            Generalized Minimal Residual method (SPIGMR).
C            This is the best choice in general.
C
C          3 means the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method (PCG).
C            Recommended only when df/dy is symmetric or nearly so.
C
C          4 means the scaled Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method
C            (PCGS).  Recommended only when D-inverse * df/dy * D is
C            symmetric or nearly so, where D is the diagonal scaling
C            matrix with elements 1/EWT(i) (see RTOL/ATOL description).
C
C          9 means that only a user-supplied matrix P (approximating A)
C            will be used, with no Krylov iteration done.  This option
C            allows the user to provide the complete linear system
C            solution algorithm, if desired.
C
C The user can apply preconditioning to the linear system A*x = b,
C by means of arbitrary matrices (the preconditioners).
C     In the case of SPIOM and SPIGMR, one can apply left and right
C preconditioners P1 and P2, and the basic iterative method is then
C applied to the matrix (P1-inverse)*A*(P2-inverse) instead of to the
C matrix A.  The product P1*P2 should be an approximation to matrix A
C such that linear systems with P1 or P2 are easier to solve than with
C A.  Preconditioning from the left only or right only means using
C P2 = identity or P1 = identity, respectively.
C     In the case of the PCG and PCGS methods, there is only one
C preconditioner matrix P (but it can be the product of more than one).
C It should approximate the matrix A but allow for relatively
C easy solution of linear systems with coefficient matrix P.
C For PCG, P should be positive definite symmetric, or nearly so,
C and for PCGS, the scaled preconditioner D-inverse * P * D
C should be symmetric or nearly so.
C     If the Jacobian J = df/dy splits in a natural way into a sum
C J = J1 + J2, then one possible choice of preconditioners is
C     P1 = identity - hl0 * J1  and  P2 = identity - hl0 * J2
C provided each of these is easy to solve (or approximately solve).

C Summary of Usage.
C
C Communication between the user and the DLSODPK package, for normal
C situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
C of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
C details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
C and instructions for special situations.  See also the demonstration
C program distributed with this solver.
C
C A. First provide a subroutine of the form:
C               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
C which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with f(i).
C
C B. Next determine (or guess) whether or not the problem is stiff.
C Stiffness occurs when the Jacobian matrix df/dy has an eigenvalue
C whose real part is negative and large in magnitude, compared to the
C reciprocal of the t span of interest.  If the problem is nonstiff,
C use a method flag MF = 10.  If it is stiff, MF should be between 21
C and 24, or possibly 29.  MF = 22 is generally the best choice.
C Use 23 or 24 only if symmetry is present.  Use MF = 29 if the
C complete linear system solution is to be provided by the user.
C The following four parameters must also be set.
C  IWORK(1) = LWP  = length of real array WP for preconditioning.
C  IWORK(2) = LIWP = length of integer array IWP for preconditioning.
C  IWORK(3) = JPRE = preconditioner type flag:
C                  = 0 for no preconditioning (P1 = P2 = P = identity)
C                  = 1 for left-only preconditioning (P2 = identity)
C                  = 2 for right-only preconditioning (P1 = identity)
C                  = 3 for two-sided preconditioning (and PCG or PCGS)
C  IWORK(4) = JACFLG = flag for whether JAC is called.
C                    = 0 if JAC is not to be called,
C                    = 1 if JAC is to be called.
C  Use JACFLG = 1 if JAC computes any nonconstant data for use in
C  preconditioning, such as Jacobian elements.
C  The arrays WP and IWP are work arrays under the user's control,
C  for use in the routines that perform preconditioning operations.
C
C C. If the problem is stiff, you must supply two routines that deal
C with the preconditioning of the linear systems to be solved.
C These are as follows:
C
C     SUBROUTINE JAC (F, NEQ, T, Y, YSV, REWT, FTY, V, HL0, WP,IWP, IER)
C     DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*),YSV(*), REWT(*), FTY(*), V(*), HL0, WP(*)
C     INTEGER IWP(*)
C        This routine must evaluate and preprocess any parts of the
C     Jacobian matrix df/dy involved in the preconditioners P1, P2, P.
C     The Y and FTY arrays contain the current values of y and f(t,y),
C     respectively, and YSV also contains the current value of y.
C     The array V is work space of length NEQ.
C     JAC must multiply all computed Jacobian elements by the scalar
C     -HL0, add the identity matrix, and do any factorization
C     operations called for, in preparation for solving linear systems
C     with a coefficient matrix of P1, P2, or P.  The matrix P1*P2 or P
C     should be an approximation to  identity - HL0 * (df/dy).
C     JAC should return IER = 0 if successful, and IER .ne. 0 if not.
C     (If IER .ne. 0, a smaller time step will be tried.)
C
C     SUBROUTINE PSOL (NEQ, T, Y, FTY, WK, HL0, WP, IWP, B, LR, IER)
C     DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), FTY(*), WK(*), HL0, WP(*), B(*)
C     INTEGER IWP(*)
C        This routine must solve a linear system with B as right-hand
C     side and one of the preconditioning matrices, P1, P2, or P, as
C     coefficient matrix, and return the solution vector in B.
C     LR is a flag concerning left vs right preconditioning, input
C     to PSOL.  PSOL is to use P1 if LR = 1 and P2 if LR = 2.
C     In the case of the PCG or PCGS method, LR will be 3, and PSOL
C     should solve the system P*x = B with the preconditioner matrix P.
C     In the case MF = 29 (no Krylov iteration), LR will be 0,
C     and PSOL is to return in B the desired approximate solution
C     to A * x = B, where A = identity - HL0 * (df/dy).
C     PSOL can use data generated in the JAC routine and stored in
C     WP and IWP.  WK is a work array of length NEQ.
C     The argument HL0 is the current value of the scalar appearing
C     in the linear system.  If the old value, at the time of the last
C     JAC call, is needed, it must have been saved by JAC in WP.
C     On return, PSOL should set the error flag IER as follows:
C       IER = 0 if PSOL was successful,
C       IER .gt. 0 if a recoverable error occurred, meaning that the
C              time step will be retried,
C       IER .lt. 0 if an unrecoverable error occurred, meaning that the
C              solver is to stop immediately.
C
C D. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODPK once for
C each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
C for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages by
C DLSODPK.  On the first call to DLSODPK, supply arguments as follows:
C F      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
C          This name must be declared External in calling program.
C NEQ    = number of first order ODEs.
C Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
C T      = the initial value of the independent variable.
C TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
C ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
C RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
C ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
C          the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
C          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
C          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
C          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
C          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
C          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
C          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
C          control.  Caution: Actual (global) errors may exceed these
C          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
C ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
C ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1.
C IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
C RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
C             20 + 16*NEQ           for MF = 10,
C             45 + 17*NEQ + LWP     for MF = 21,
C             61 + 17*NEQ + LWP     for MF = 22,
C             20 + 15*NEQ + LWP     for MF = 23 or 24,
C             20 + 12*NEQ + LWP     for MF = 29.
C LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
C IWORK  = integer work array of length at least:
C             30            for MF = 10,
C             35 + LIWP     for MF = 21,
C             30 + LIWP     for MF = 22, 23, 24, or 29.
C LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension).
C JAC,PSOL = names of subroutines for preconditioning.
C          These names must be declared External in the calling program.
C MF     = method flag.  Standard values are:
C          10 for nonstiff (Adams) method.
C          21 for stiff (BDF) method, with preconditioned SIOM.
C          22 for stiff method, with preconditioned GMRES method.
C          23 for stiff method, with preconditioned CG method.
C          24 for stiff method, with scaled preconditioned CG method.
C          29 for stiff method, with user's PSOL routine only.
C Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, RWORK, IWORK,
C and possibly ATOL.
C
C E. The output from the first call (or any call) is:
C      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
C      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
C ISTATE = 2  if DLSODPK was successful, negative otherwise.
C          -1 means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong MF).
C          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
C          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
C          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
C          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad JAC
C             or PSOL routine supplied or wrong choice of MF or
C             tolerances, or this solver is inappropriate).
C          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
C             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
C          -7 means an unrecoverable error occurred in PSOL.
C
C F. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
C reset TOUT and call DLSODPK again.  No other parameters need be reset.

C Full Description of User Interface to DLSODPK.
C
C The user interface to DLSODPK consists of the following parts.
C
C 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODPK, which is a driver
C      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
C      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
C      Following these descriptions is a description of
C      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
C      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
C
C 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODPK package that may be
C      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
C      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
C      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
C
C 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
C      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
C      of the problem and continued solution later.
C
C 4.   Description of two routines in the DLSODPK package, either of
C      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
C      These relate to the measurement of errors.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 1.  Call Sequence.
C
C The call sequence parameters used for input only are
C  F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, PSOL, MF,
C and those used for both input and output are
C  Y, T, ISTATE.
C The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
C optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
C to the return from Subroutine DLSODPK to the user's calling program.)
C
C The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
C initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
C change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
C
C The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
C
C F      = the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the
C          ODE system.  The system must be put in the first-order
C          form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function
C          of the scalar t and the vector y.  Subroutine F is to
C          compute the function f.  It is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
C          where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT = f(t,y)
C          is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
C          Subroutine F should not alter Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).
C          F must be declared External in the calling program.
C
C          Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
C
C          If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
C          externally to DLSODPK, an extra call to F should be made
C          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
C          If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY instead.
C
C NEQ    = the size of the ODE system (number of first order
C          ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
C          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
C          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
C          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
C          these are to be accessed in the user-supplied subroutines.
C
C          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
C          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
C          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
C          (The DLSODPK package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
C          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
C          to F, JAC, and PSOL.  Hence, if it is an array, locations
C          NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data and pass
C          it to the user-supplied subroutines.  Each such routine must
C          include NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
C
C Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
C          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
C          first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on other calls.
C          On the first call, Y must contain the vector of initial
C          values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution vector,
C          evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
C          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
C
C          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to F,
C          JAC, and PSOL. Hence its length may exceed NEQ, and locations
C          Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real data and
C          pass it to the user-supplied subroutines.  (The DLSODPK
C          package accesses only Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).)
C
C T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
C          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
C          On output, after each call, T is the value at which a
C          computed solution y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
C          On an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
C
C TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
C          Used only for input.
C
C          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
C          to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next call.
C          For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is used
C          in order to determine the direction of the integration
C          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
C          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
C          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
C
C          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
C          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
C          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
C
C          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
C          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
C          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
C          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
C          TCUR and HU).
C
C ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
C          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
C
C RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
C          Input only.
C
C ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
C
C             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
C          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
C          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
C          in y, according to an inequality of the form
C                      RMS-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
C          where       EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
C          and the RMS-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
C          RMS-norm(v) = SQRT(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).  Here EWT = (EWT(i))
C          is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
C          the values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
C          the following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
C          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
C
C             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
C              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              4     array      array      RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C
C          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
C          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
C
C          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
C          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
C          error controls can be obtained by substituting
C          user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
C          the norm calculation.  See Part 4 below.
C
C          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
C          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
C          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
C          down uniformly.
C
C ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
C          Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
C          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
C          2  means take one step only and return.
C          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
C             beyond t = TOUT and return.
C          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
C             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
C             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
C             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
C          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
C
C          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
C          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
C          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
C          in which case answers at t = TOUT are returned first).
C
C ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
C          the state of the calculation.
C
C          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
C          1  means this is the first call for the problem
C             (initializations will be done).  See note below.
C          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
C             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
C             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
C             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
C             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
C             tested for legality.)
C          3  means this is not the first call, and the
C             calculation is to continue normally, but with
C             a change in input parameters other than
C             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
C             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
C             and any of the optional inputs except H0.
C          Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
C          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
C          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
C          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
C          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
C          ISTATE = 1 on input.
C
C          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
C           1  means nothing was done; TOUT = T and ISTATE = 1 on input.
C           2  means the integration was performed successfully.
C          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
C              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
C              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
C              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
C              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
C              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
C              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
C              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
C              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
C          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
C              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
C              completing the requested task, but the integration
C              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
C              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
C              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
C              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
C              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
C              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
C          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
C              integration steps.  See written message for details.
C              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
C              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
C              the run to stop.
C          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
C              may be inappropriate.
C          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
C              integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0)
C              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
C              The integration was successful as far as T.
C          -7  means the PSOL routine returned an unrecoverable error
C              flag (IER .lt. 0).  The integration was successful as
C              far as T.
C
C          Note:  since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
C          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
C          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
C          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
C          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
C          calling the solver again.
C
C IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
C          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
C          The optional inputs are listed separately below.
C          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
C                   Default values will be used in all cases.
C          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
C
C RWORK  = a real working array (double precision).
C          The length of RWORK must be at least
C             20 + NYH*(MAXORD + 1) + 3*NEQ + LENLS + LWP    where
C          NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
C          MAXORD = 12 (if METH = 1) or 5 (if METH = 2) (unless a
C                   smaller value is given as an optional input),
C          LENLS = length of work space for linear system (Krylov)
C                  method, excluding preconditioning:
C            LENLS = 0                               if MITER = 0,
C            LENLS = NEQ*(MAXL+3) + MAXL**2          if MITER = 1,
C            LENLS = NEQ*(MAXL+3+MIN(1,MAXL-KMP))
C                 + (MAXL+3)*MAXL + 1                if MITER = 2,
C            LENLS = 6*NEQ                           if MITER = 3 or 4,
C            LENLS = 3*NEQ                           if MITER = 9.
C          (See the MF description for METH and MITER, and the
C          list of optional inputs for MAXL and KMP.)
C          LWP = length of real user work space for preconditioning
C          (see JAC/PSOL).
C          Thus if default values are used and NEQ is constant,
C          this length is:
C             20 + 16*NEQ           for MF = 10,
C             45 + 24*NEQ + LWP     FOR MF = 11,
C             61 + 24*NEQ + LWP     FOR MF = 12,
C             20 + 22*NEQ + LWP     FOR MF = 13 OR 14,
C             20 + 19*NEQ + LWP     FOR MF = 19,
C             20 + 9*NEQ            FOR MF = 20,
C             45 + 17*NEQ + LWP     FOR MF = 21,
C             61 + 17*NEQ + LWP     FOR MF = 22,
C             20 + 15*NEQ + LWP     FOR MF = 23 OR 24,
C             20 + 12*NEQ + LWP     for MF = 29.
C          The first 20 words of RWORK are reserved for conditional
C          and optional inputs and optional outputs.
C
C          The following word in RWORK is a conditional input:
C            RWORK(1) = TCRIT = critical value of t which the solver
C                       is not to overshoot.  Required if ITASK is
C                       4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  (See ITASK.)
C
C LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C IWORK  = an integer work array.  The length of IWORK must be at least
C             30                 if MITER = 0 (MF = 10 or 20),
C             30 + MAXL + LIWP   if MITER = 1 (MF = 11, 21),
C             30 + LIWP          if MITER = 2, 3, 4, or 9.
C          MAXL = 5 unless a different optional input value is given.
C          LIWP = length of integer user work space for preconditioning
C          (see conditional input list following).
C          The first few words of IWORK are used for conditional and
C          optional inputs and optional outputs.
C
C          The following 4 words in IWORK are conditional inputs,
C          required if MITER .ge. 1:
C          IWORK(1) = LWP  = length of real array WP for use in
C                     preconditioning (part of RWORK array).
C          IWORK(2) = LIWP = length of integer array IWP for use in
C                     preconditioning (part of IWORK array).
C                     The arrays WP and IWP are work arrays under the
C                     user's control, for use in the routines that
C                     perform preconditioning operations (JAC and PSOL).
C          IWORK(3) = JPRE = preconditioner type flag:
C                   = 0 for no preconditioning (P1 = P2 = P = identity)
C                   = 1 for left-only preconditioning (P2 = identity)
C                   = 2 for right-only preconditioning (P1 = identity)
C                   = 3 for two-sided preconditioning (and PCG or PCGS)
C          IWORK(4) = JACFLG = flag for whether JAC is called.
C                   = 0 if JAC is not to be called,
C                   = 1 if JAC is to be called.
C                     Use JACFLG = 1 if JAC computes any nonconstant
C                     data needed in preconditioning operations,
C                     such as some of the Jacobian elements.
C
C LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C Note:  The work arrays must not be altered between calls to DLSODPK
C for the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and
C optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
C The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
C available for use by the user outside DLSODPK between calls, if
C desired (but not for use by any of the user-supplied subroutines).
C
C JAC    = the name of the user-supplied routine to compute any
C          Jacobian elements (or approximations) involved in the
C          matrix preconditioning operations (MITER .ge. 1).
C          It is to have the form
C            SUBROUTINE JAC (F, NEQ, T, Y, YSV, REWT, FTY, V,
C           1                HL0, WP, IWP, IER)
C            DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*),YSV(*), REWT(*), FTY(*), V(*),
C           1                 HL0, WP(*)
C            INTEGER IWP(*)
C          This routine must evaluate and preprocess any parts of the
C          Jacobian matrix df/dy used in the preconditioners P1, P2, P.
C          the Y and FTY arrays contain the current values of y and
C          f(t,y), respectively, and YSV also contains the current
C          value of y.  The array V is work space of length
C          NEQ for use by JAC.  REWT is the array of reciprocal error
C          weights (1/EWT).  JAC must multiply all computed Jacobian
C          elements by the scalar -HL0, add the identity matrix, and do
C          any factorization operations called for, in preparation
C          for solving linear systems with a coefficient matrix of
C          P1, P2, or P.  The matrix P1*P2 or P should be an
C          approximation to  identity - HL0 * (df/dy).  JAC should
C          return IER = 0 if successful, and IER .ne. 0 if not.
C          (If IER .ne. 0, a smaller time step will be tried.)
C          The arrays WP (of length LWP) and IWP (of length LIWP)
C          are for use by JAC and PSOL for work space and for storage
C          of data needed for the solution of the preconditioner
C          linear systems.  Their lengths and contents are under the
C          user's control.
C          The JAC routine may save relevant Jacobian elements (or
C          approximations) used in the preconditioners, along with the
C          value of HL0, and use these to reconstruct preconditioner
C          matrices later without reevaluationg those elements.
C          This may be cost-effective if JAC is called with HL0
C          considerably different from its earlier value, indicating
C          that a corrector convergence failure has occurred because
C          of the change in HL0, not because of changes in the
C          value of the Jacobian.  In doing this, use the saved and
C          current values of HL0 to decide whether to use saved
C          or reevaluated elements.
C          JAC may alter V, but may not alter Y, YSV, REWT, FTY, or HL0.
C          JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
C               Subroutine JAC may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in JAC) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
C
C PSOL   = the name of the user-supplied routine for the
C          solution of preconditioner linear systems.
C          It is to have the form
C            SUBROUTINE PSOL (NEQ, T, Y, FTY, WK,HL0, WP,IWP, B, LR,IER)
C            DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), FTY(*), WK(*), HL0, WP(*), B(*)
C            INTEGER IWP(*)
C          This routine must solve a linear system with B as right-hand
C          side and one of the preconditioning matrices, P1, P2, or P,
C          as coefficient matrix, and return the solution vector in B.
C          LR is a flag concerning left vs right preconditioning, input
C          to PSOL.  PSOL is to use P1 if LR = 1 and P2 if LR = 2.
C          In the case of the PCG or PCGS method, LR will be 3, and PSOL
C          should solve the system P*x = B with the preconditioner P.
C          In the case MITER = 9 (no Krylov iteration), LR will be 0,
C          and PSOL is to return in B the desired approximate solution
C          to A * x = B, where A = identity - HL0 * (df/dy).
C          PSOL can use data generated in the JAC routine and stored in
C          WP and IWP.
C          The Y and FTY arrays contain the current values of y and
C          f(t,y), respectively.  The array WK is work space of length
C          NEQ for use by PSOL.
C          The argument HL0 is the current value of the scalar appearing
C          in the linear system.  If the old value, as of the last
C          JAC call, is needed, it must have been saved by JAC in WP.
C          On return, PSOL should set the error flag IER as follows:
C            IER = 0 if PSOL was successful,
C            IER .gt. 0 on a recoverable error, meaning that the
C                   time step will be retried,
C            IER .lt. 0 on an unrecoverable error, meaning that the
C                   solver is to stop immediately.
C          PSOL may not alter Y, FTY, or HL0.
C          PSOL must be declared External in the calling program.
C               Subroutine PSOL may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in PSOL) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
C
C MF     = the method flag.  Used only for input.  The legal values of
C          MF are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 29.
C          MF has decimal digits METH and MITER: MF = 10*METH + MITER.
C          METH indicates the basic linear multistep method:
C            METH = 1 means the implicit Adams method.
C            METH = 2 means the method based on Backward
C                     Differentiation Formulas (BDFs).
C          MITER indicates the corrector iteration method:
C            MITER = 0 means functional iteration (no linear system
C                      is involved).
C            MITER = 1 means Newton iteration with Scaled Preconditioned
C                      Incomplete Orthogonalization Method (SPIOM)
C                      for the linear systems.
C            MITER = 2 means Newton iteration with Scaled Preconditioned
C                      Generalized Minimal Residual method (SPIGMR)
C                      for the linear systems.
C            MITER = 3 means Newton iteration with Preconditioned
C                      Conjugate Gradient method (PCG)
C                      for the linear systems.
C            MITER = 4 means Newton iteration with scaled Preconditioned
C                      Conjugate Gradient method (PCGS)
C                      for the linear systems.
C            MITER = 9 means Newton iteration with only the
C                      user-supplied PSOL routine called (no Krylov
C                      iteration) for the linear systems.
C                      JPRE is ignored, and PSOL is called with LR = 0.
C          See comments in the introduction about the choice of MITER.
C          If MITER .ge. 1, the user must supply routines JAC and PSOL
C          (the names are arbitrary) as described above.
C          For MITER = 0, dummy arguments can be used.

C Optional Inputs.
C
C The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
C call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
C this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
C location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
C The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
C case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
C of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
C Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
C locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
C then set those of interest to nonzero values.
C
C Name    Location      Meaning and Default Value
C
C H0      RWORK(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
C                   The default value is determined by the solver.
C
C HMAX    RWORK(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is infinite.
C
C HMIN    RWORK(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
C                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
C                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
C
C DELT    RWORK(8)  convergence test constant in Krylov iteration
C                   algorithm.  The default is .05.
C
C MAXORD  IWORK(5)  the maximum order to be allowed.  The default
C                   value is 12 if METH = 1, and 5 if METH = 2.
C                   If MAXORD exceeds the default value, it will
C                   be reduced to the default value.
C                   If MAXORD is changed during the problem, it may
C                   cause the current order to be reduced.
C
C MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
C                   allowed during one call to the solver.
C                   The default value is 500.
C
C MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
C                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
C                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
C                   value.  The default value is 10.
C
C MAXL    IWORK(8)  maximum number of iterations in the SPIOM, SPIGMR,
C                   PCG, or PCGS algorithm (.le. NEQ).
C                   The default is MAXL = MIN(5,NEQ).
C
C KMP     IWORK(9)  number of vectors on which orthogonalization
C                   is done in SPIOM or SPIGMR algorithm (.le. MAXL).
C                   The default is KMP = MAXL.
C                   Note:  When KMP .lt. MAXL and MF = 22, the length
C                          of RWORK must be defined accordingly.  See
C                          the definition of RWORK above.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Outputs.
C
C As optional additional output from DLSODPK, the variables listed
C below are quantities related to the performance of DLSODPK
C which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
C the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
C Except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
C on any successful return from DLSODPK, and on any return with
C ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, -6, or -7.  On an illegal input return
C (ISTATE = -3), they will be unchanged from their existing values
C (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
C On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
C as noted below.
C
C Name    Location      Meaning
C
C HU      RWORK(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
C
C HCUR    RWORK(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
C
C TCUR    RWORK(13) the current value of the independent variable
C                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
C                   current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
C                   will always be at least as far as the argument
C                   T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
C
C TOLSF   RWORK(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
C                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
C                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
C                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
C                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
C                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
C                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
C                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
C                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
C
C NST     IWORK(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
C
C NFE     IWORK(12) the number of f evaluations for the problem so far.
C
C NPE     IWORK(13) the number of calls to JAC so far (for Jacobian
C                   evaluation associated with preconditioning).
C
C NQU     IWORK(14) the method order last used (successfully).
C
C NQCUR   IWORK(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.
C
C IMXER   IWORK(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
C                   the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
C                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
C
C LENRW   IWORK(17) the length of RWORK actually required.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C LENIW   IWORK(18) the length of IWORK actually required.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C NNI     IWORK(19) number of nonlinear iterations so far (each of
C                   which calls an iterative linear solver).
C
C NLI     IWORK(20) number of linear iterations so far.
C                   Note: A measure of the success of algorithm is
C                   the average number of linear iterations per
C                   nonlinear iteration, given by NLI/NNI.
C                   If this is close to MAXL, MAXL may be too small.
C
C NPS     IWORK(21) number of preconditioning solve operations
C                   (PSOL calls) so far.
C
C NCFN    IWORK(22) number of convergence failures of the nonlinear
C                   (Newton) iteration so far.
C                   Note: A measure of success is the overall
C                   rate of nonlinear convergence failures, NCFN/NST.
C
C NCFL    IWORK(23) number of convergence failures of the linear
C                   iteration so far.
C                   Note: A measure of success is the overall
C                   rate of linear convergence failures, NCFL/NNI.
C
C The following two arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
C may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
C For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
C its base address in RWORK, and its description.
C
C Name    Base Address      Description
C
C YH      21             the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
C                        (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
C                        of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
C                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
C                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
C                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
C                        evaluated at t = TCUR.
C
C ACOR     LENRW-NEQ+1   array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
C                        corrections on each step, scaled on output
C                        to represent the estimated local error in y
C                        on the last step.  This is the vector E in
C                        the description of the error control.  It is
C                        defined only on a successful return from
C                        DLSODPK.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.
C
C The following are optional calls which the user may make to
C gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSODPK.
C (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
C SLATEC error handling package.)
C
C     Form of Call                  Function
C   CALL XSETUN(LUN)          Set the logical unit number, LUN, for
C                             output of messages from DLSODPK, if
C                             the default is not desired.
C                             The default value of lun is 6.
C
C   CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         Set a flag to control the printing of
C                             messages by DLSODPK.
C                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger:
C                             This risks losing valuable information.)
C                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).
C
C                             Either of the above calls may be made at
C                             any time and will take effect immediately.
C
C   CALL DSRCPK(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) saves and restores the contents of
C                             the internal Common blocks used by
C                             DLSODPK (see Part 3 below).
C                             RSAV must be a real array of length 222
C                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
C                             array of length 50 or more.
C                             JOB=1 means save Common into RSAV/ISAV.
C                             JOB=2 means restore Common from RSAV/ISAV.
C                                DSRCPK is useful if one is
C                             interrupting a run and restarting
C                             later, or alternating between two or
C                             more problems solved with DLSODPK.
C
C   CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        Provide derivatives of y, of various
C        (See below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
C                             desired.  It may be called only after
C                             a successful return from DLSODPK.
C
C The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.
C The form of the call is:
C
C   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(21), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
C
C The input parameters are:
C
C T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
C             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODPK).
C             for valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
C             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
C K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
C             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
C             (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
C             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(T), is already provided
C             by DLSODPK directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
C             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
C RWORK(21) = the base address of the history array YH.
C NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
C
C The output parameters are:
C
C DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
C             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
C IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
C             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
C             On an error return, a message is also written.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 3.  Common Blocks.
C
C If DLSODPK is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
C must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
C   (1) the call sequence to DLSODPK, and
C   (2) the two internal Common blocks
C         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
C                      followed by 37 integer words),
C         /DLPK01/  of length  17  (4 double precision words
C                      followed by 13 integer words).
C
C If DLSODPK is used on a system in which the contents of internal
C Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
C declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure
C that their contents are preserved.
C
C If the solution of a given problem by DLSODPK is to be interrupted
C and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
C or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
C following the return from the last DLSODPK call prior to the
C interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
C internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
C next DLSODPK call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
C blocks, use Subroutine DSRCPK (see Part 2 above).
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
C
C below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSODPK package which
C relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
C replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
C a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
C done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
C (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
C superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
C
C (a) DEWSET.
C The following subroutine is called just before each internal
C integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
C described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
C     SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
C where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODPK call sequence,
C YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
C EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
C
C If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
C (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
C in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the DVNORM
C routine (see below), and also used by DLSODPK in the computation
C of the optional output IMXER, the diagonal Jacobian approximation,
C and the increments for difference quotient Jacobians.
C
C In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
C the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
C are available from the history array YH, described above under
C optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
C extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
C factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
C given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
C NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
C can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
C     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
C     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
C     NQ = ILS(33)
C     NST = ILS(34)
C     H = RLS(212)
C Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
C YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
C unnecessary when NST = 0).
C
C (b) DVNORM.
C The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
C root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
C     D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
C where:
C   N = the length of the vector,
C   V = real array of length N containing the vector,
C   W = real array of length N containing weights,
C   D = SQRT( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
C DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
C EWT is as set by Subroutine DEWSET.
C
C If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
C value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSODPK.
C None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
C For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
C   -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*W(i)) for the RMS-norm, or
C   -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
C    suppressing the error control on those components of y.

C DLSODKR: Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential equations,
C          with preconditioned Krylov iteration methods for the
C          Newton correction linear systems, and with Rootfinding.
C
C This version is in double precision.
C
C DLSODKR solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
C systems of first order ODEs,
C     dy/dt = f(t,y) ,  or, in component form,
C     dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ)) (i = 1,...,NEQ).
C At the same time, it locates the roots of any of a set of functions
C     g(i) = g(i,t,y(1),...,y(NEQ))  (i = 1,...,ng).

C Introduction.
C
C This is a modification of the DLSODE package, and differs from it
C in five ways:
C (a) It uses various preconditioned Krylov subspace iteration methods
C for the linear algebraic systems that arise in the case of stiff
C systems.  See the introductory notes below.
C (b) It does automatic switching between functional (fixpoint)
C iteration and Newton iteration in the corrector iteration.
C (c) It finds the root of at least one of a set of constraint
C functions g(i) of the independent and dependent variables.
C It finds only those roots for which some g(i), as a function
C of t, changes sign in the interval of integration.
C It then returns the solution at the root, if that occurs
C sooner than the specified stop condition, and otherwise returns
C the solution according the specified stop condition.
C (d) It supplies to JAC an input flag, JOK, which indicates whether
C JAC may (optionally) bypass the evaluation of Jacobian matrix data
C and instead process saved data (with the current value of scalar hl0).
C (e) It contains a new subroutine that calculates the initial step
C size to be attempted.
C
C
C Introduction to the Krylov methods in DLSODKR:
C
C The linear systems that must be solved have the form
C   A * x  = b ,  where  A = identity - hl0 * (df/dy) .
C Here hl0 is a scalar, and df/dy is the Jacobian matrix of partial
C derivatives of f (NEQ by NEQ).
C
C The particular Krylov method is chosen by setting the second digit,
C MITER, in the method flag MF.
C Currently, the values of MITER have the following meanings:
C
C  MITER = 1 means the Scaled Preconditioned Incomplete
C            Orthogonalization Method (SPIOM).
C
C          2 means an incomplete version of the preconditioned scaled
C            Generalized Minimal Residual method (SPIGMR).
C            This is the best choice in general.
C
C          3 means the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method (PCG).
C            Recommended only when df/dy is symmetric or nearly so.
C
C          4 means the scaled Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method
C            (PCGS).  Recommended only when D-inverse * df/dy * D is
C            symmetric or nearly so, where D is the diagonal scaling
C            matrix with elements 1/EWT(i) (see RTOL/ATOL description).
C
C          9 means that only a user-supplied matrix P (approximating A)
C            will be used, with no Krylov iteration done.  This option
C            allows the user to provide the complete linear system
C            solution algorithm, if desired.
C
C The user can apply preconditioning to the linear system A*x = b,
C by means of arbitrary matrices (the preconditioners).
C     In the case of SPIOM and SPIGMR, one can apply left and right
C preconditioners P1 and P2, and the basic iterative method is then
C applied to the matrix (P1-inverse)*A*(P2-inverse) instead of to the
C matrix A.  The product P1*P2 should be an approximation to matrix A
C such that linear systems with P1 or P2 are easier to solve than with
C A.  Preconditioning from the left only or right only means using
C P2 = identity or P1 = identity, respectively.
C     In the case of the PCG and PCGS methods, there is only one
C preconditioner matrix P (but it can be the product of more than one).
C It should approximate the matrix A but allow for relatively
C easy solution of linear systems with coefficient matrix P.
C For PCG, P should be positive definite symmetric, or nearly so,
C and for PCGS, the scaled preconditioner D-inverse * P * D
C should be symmetric or nearly so.
C     If the Jacobian J = df/dy splits in a natural way into a sum
C J = J1 + J2, then one possible choice of preconditioners is
C     P1 = identity - hl0 * J1  and  P2 = identity - hl0 * J2
C provided each of these is easy to solve (or approximately solve).

C Summary of Usage.
C
C Communication between the user and the DLSODKR package, for normal
C situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
C of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
C details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
C and instructions for special situations.  See also the demonstration
C program distributed with this solver.
C
C A. First provide a subroutine of the form:
C               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
C which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with f(i).
C
C B. Provide a subroutine of the form:
C               SUBROUTINE G (NEQ, T, Y, NG, GOUT)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), GOUT(NG)
C which supplies the vector function g by loading GOUT(i) with
C g(i), the i-th constraint function whose root is sought.
C
C C. Next determine (or guess) whether or not the problem is stiff.
C Stiffness occurs when the Jacobian matrix df/dy has an eigenvalue
C whose real part is negative and large in magnitude, compared to the
C reciprocal of the t span of interest.  If the problem is nonstiff,
C use a method flag MF = 10.  If it is stiff, MF should be between 21
C and 24, or possibly 29.  MF = 22 is generally the best choice.
C Use 23 or 24 only if symmetry is present.  Use MF = 29 if the
C complete linear system solution is to be provided by the user.
C The following four parameters must also be set.
C  IWORK(1) = LWP  = length of real array WP for preconditioning.
C  IWORK(2) = LIWP = length of integer array IWP for preconditioning.
C  IWORK(3) = JPRE = preconditioner type flag:
C                  = 0 for no preconditioning (P1 = P2 = P = identity)
C                  = 1 for left-only preconditioning (P2 = identity)
C                  = 2 for right-only preconditioning (P1 = identity)
C                  = 3 for two-sided preconditioning (and PCG or PCGS)
C  IWORK(4) = JACFLG = flag for whether JAC is called.
C                    = 0 if JAC is not to be called,
C                    = 1 if JAC is to be called.
C  Use JACFLG = 1 if JAC computes any nonconstant data for use in
C  preconditioning, such as Jacobian elements.
C  The arrays WP and IWP are work arrays under the user's control,
C  for use in the routines that perform preconditioning operations.
C
C D. If the problem is stiff, you must supply two routines that deal
C with the preconditioning of the linear systems to be solved.
C These are as follows:
C
C     SUBROUTINE JAC (F, NEQ, T, Y, YSV, REWT, FTY,V,HL0,JOK,WP,IWP,IER)
C     DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YSV(*), REWT(*), FTY(*), V(*), HL0,WP(*)
C     INTEGER IWP(*)
C        This routine must evaluate and preprocess any parts of the
C     Jacobian matrix df/dy involved in the preconditioners P1, P2, P.
C     The Y and FTY arrays contain the current values of y and f(t,y),
C     respectively, and YSV also contains the current value of y.
C     The array V is work space of length NEQ.
C     JAC must multiply all computed Jacobian elements by the scalar
C     -HL0, add the identity matrix, and do any factorization
C     operations called for, in preparation for solving linear systems
C     with a coefficient matrix of P1, P2, or P.  The matrix P1*P2 or P
C     should be an approximation to  identity - hl0 * (df/dy).
C     JAC should return IER = 0 if successful, and IER .ne. 0 if not.
C     (If IER .ne. 0, a smaller time step will be tried.)
C     JAC may alter Y and V, but not YSV, REWT, FTY, or HL0.
C     The JOK argument can be ignored (or see full description below).
C
C     SUBROUTINE PSOL (NEQ, T, Y, FTY, WK, HL0, WP, IWP, B, LR, IER)
C     DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), FTY(*), WK(*), HL0, WP(*), B(*)
C     INTEGER IWP(*)
C        This routine must solve a linear system with B as right-hand
C     side and one of the preconditioning matrices, P1, P2, or P, as
C     coefficient matrix, and return the solution vector in B.
C     LR is a flag concerning left vs right preconditioning, input
C     to PSOL.  PSOL is to use P1 if LR = 1 and P2 if LR = 2.
C     In the case of the PCG or PCGS method, LR will be 3, and PSOL
C     should solve the system P*x = B with the preconditioner matrix P.
C     In the case MF = 29 (no Krylov iteration), LR will be 0,
C     and PSOL is to return in B the desired approximate solution
C     to A * x = B, where A = identity - hl0 * (df/dy).
C     PSOL can use data generated in the JAC routine and stored in
C     WP and IWP.  WK is a work array of length NEQ.
C     The argument HL0 is the current value of the scalar appearing
C     in the linear system.  If the old value, at the time of the last
C     JAC call, is needed, it must have been saved by JAC in WP.
C     on return, PSOL should set the error flag IER as follows:
C       IER = 0 if PSOL was successful,
C       IER .gt. 0 if a recoverable error occurred, meaning that the
C              time step will be retried,
C       IER .lt. 0 if an unrecoverable error occurred, meaning that the
C              solver is to stop immediately.
C
C E. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODKR once for
C each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
C for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
C by DLSODKR.  On the first call to DLSODKR, supply arguments as
C follows:
C F      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
C          This name must be declared External in calling program.
C NEQ    = number of first order ODEs.
C Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
C T      = the initial value of the independent variable.
C TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
C ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
C RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
C ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
C          The estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
C          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
C          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
C          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
C          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
C          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
C          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
C          control.  Caution: Actual (global) errors may exceed these
C          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
C ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
C ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1.
C IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
C RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
C             20 + 16*NEQ + 3*NG           for MF = 10,
C             45 + 17*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 21,
C             61 + 17*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 22,
C             20 + 15*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 23 or 24,
C             20 + 12*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 29.
C LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
C IWORK  = integer work array of length at least:
C             30            for MF = 10,
C             35 + LIWP     for MF = 21,
C             30 + LIWP     for MF = 22, 23, 24, or 29.
C LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension).
C JAC,PSOL = names of subroutines for preconditioning.
C          These names must be declared External in the calling program.
C MF     = method flag.  Standard values are:
C          10 for nonstiff (Adams) method.
C          21 for stiff (BDF) method, with preconditioned SIOM.
C          22 for stiff method, with preconditioned GMRES method.
C          23 for stiff method, with preconditioned CG method.
C          24 for stiff method, with scaled preconditioned CG method.
C          29 for stiff method, with user's PSOL routine only.
C G      = name of subroutine for constraint functions, whose
C          roots are desired during the integration.
C          This name must be declared External in calling program.
C NG     = number of constraint functions g(i).  If there are none,
C          set NG = 0, and pass a dummy name for G.
C JROOT  = integer array of length NG for output of root information.
C          See next paragraph.
C Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, RWORK, IWORK,
C JROOT, and possibly ATOL.
C
C F. The output from the first call (or any call) is:
C      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
C      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
C ISTATE = 2 or 3  if DLSODKR was successful, negative otherwise.
C           2 means no root was found, and TOUT was reached as desired.
C           3 means a root was found prior to reaching TOUT.
C          -1 means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong MF).
C          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
C          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
C          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
C          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad JAC
C             or PSOL routine supplied or wrong choice of MF or
C             tolerances, or this solver is inappropriate).
C          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
C             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
C          -7 means an unrecoverable error occurred in PSOL.
C JROOT  = array showing roots found if ISTATE = 3 on return.
C          JROOT(i) = 1 if g(i) has a root at T, or 0 otherwise.
C
C G. To continue the integration after a successful return, proceed
C as follows:
C (a) If ISTATE = 2 on return, reset TOUT and call DLSODKR again.
C (b) If ISTATE = 3 on return, reset ISTATE to 2 and call DLSODKR again.
C In either case, no other parameters need be reset.

C Full Description of User Interface to DLSODKR.
C
C The user interface to DLSODKR consists of the following parts.
C
C 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODKR, which is a driver
C      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
C      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
C      Following these descriptions is a description of
C      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
C      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
C
C 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODKR package that may be
C      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
C      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
C      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
C
C 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
C      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
C      of the problem and continued solution later.
C
C 4.   Description of two routines in the DLSODKR package, either of
C      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
C      These relate to the measurement of errors.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 1.  Call Sequence.
C
C The call sequence parameters used for input only are
C  F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, PSOL, MF,
C  G, and NG,
C that used only for output is  JROOT,
C and those used for both input and output are
C  Y, T, ISTATE.
C The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
C optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
C to the return from Subroutine DLSODKR to the user's calling program.)
C
C The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
C initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
C change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
C
C The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
C
C F      = the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the
C          ODE system.  The system must be put in the first-order
C          form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function
C          of the scalar t and the vector y.  Subroutine F is to
C          compute the function f.  It is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
C          where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT = f(t,y)
C          is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
C          Subroutine F should not alter Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).
C          F must be declared External in the calling program.
C
C          Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
C
C          If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
C          externally to DLSODKR, an extra call to F should be made
C          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
C          If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY instead.
C
C NEQ    = the size of the ODE system (number of first order
C          ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
C          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
C          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
C          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
C          these are to be accessed in the user-supplied routines.
C
C          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
C          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
C          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
C          (The DLSODKR package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
C          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
C          to the user-supplied routines.  Hence, if it is an array,
C          locations NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data
C          and pass it to the user-supplied routines. Each such routine
C          must include NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
C
C Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
C          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
C          first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on other calls.
C          On the first call, Y must contain the vector of initial
C          values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution vector,
C          evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
C          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
C
C          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to F, G,
C          JAC, and PSOL.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ, and
C          locations Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real data
C          and pass it to the user-supplied routines.
C          (The DLSODKR package accesses only Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).)
C
C T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
C          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
C          On output, after each call, T is the value at which a
C          computed solution y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
C          If a root was found, T is the computed location of the
C          root reached first, on output.
C          On an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
C
C TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
C          Used only for input.
C
C          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
C          to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next call.
C          For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is used
C          in order to determine the direction of the integration
C          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
C          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
C          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
C
C          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
C          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
C          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
C
C          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
C          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
C          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
C          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
C          TCUR and HU).
C
C ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
C          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
C
C RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
C          Input only.
C
C ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
C
C             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
C          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
C          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
C          in y, according to an inequality of the form
C                      RMS-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
C          where       EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
C          and the RMS-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
C          RMS-norm(v) = SQRT(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).  Here EWT = (EWT(i))
C          is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
C          the values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
C          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
C          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
C
C             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
C              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              4     array      array      RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C
C          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
C          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
C
C          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
C          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
C          error controls can be obtained by substituting
C          user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
C          the norm calculation.  See Part 4 below.
C
C          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
C          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
C          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
C          down uniformly.
C
C ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
C          Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
C          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
C          2  means take one step only and return.
C          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
C             beyond t = TOUT and return.
C          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
C             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
C             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
C             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
C          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
C
C          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
C          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
C          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
C          in which case answers at T = TOUT are returned first).
C
C ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
C          the state of the calculation.
C
C          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
C          1  means this is the first call for the problem
C             (initializations will be done).  See note below.
C          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
C             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
C             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
C             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
C             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
C             tested for legality.)
C          3  means this is not the first call, and the
C             calculation is to continue normally, but with
C             a change in input parameters other than
C             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
C             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
C             and any of the optional inputs except H0.
C             In addition, immediately following a return with
C             ISTATE = 3 (root found), NG and G may be changed.
C             (But changing NG from 0 to .gt. 0 is not allowed.)
C          Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
C          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
C          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
C          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
C          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
C          ISTATE = 1 on input.
C
C          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
C           1  means nothing was done; TOUT = T and ISTATE = 1 on input.
C           2  means the integration was performed successfully.
C           3  means the integration was successful, and one or more
C              roots were found before satisfying the stop condition
C              specified by ITASK.  See JROOT.
C          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
C              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
C              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
C              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
C              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
C              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
C              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
C              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
C              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
C          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
C              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
C              completing the requested task, but the integration
C              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
C              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
C              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
C              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
C              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
C              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
C          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
C              integration steps.  See written message for details.
C              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
C              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
C              the run to stop.
C          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
C              may be inappropriate.
C          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
C              integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0)
C              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
C              The integration was successful as far as T.
C          -7  means the PSOL routine returned an unrecoverable error
C              flag (IER .lt. 0).  The integration was successful as
C              far as T.
C
C          Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
C          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
C          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
C          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
C          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
C          calling the solver again.
C
C IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
C          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
C          The optional inputs are listed separately below.
C          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
C                   Default values will be used in all cases.
C          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
C
C RWORK  = a real working array (double precision).
C          The length of RWORK must be at least
C             20 + NYH*(MAXORD+1) + 3*NEQ + 3*NG + LENLS + LWP    where
C          NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
C          MAXORD = 12 (if METH = 1) or 5 (if METH = 2) (unless a
C                   smaller value is given as an optional input),
C          LENLS = length of work space for linear system (Krylov)
C                  method, excluding preconditioning:
C            LENLS = 0                               if MITER = 0,
C            LENLS = NEQ*(MAXL+3) + MAXL**2          if MITER = 1,
C            LENLS = NEQ*(MAXL+3+MIN(1,MAXL-KMP))
C                 + (MAXL+3)*MAXL + 1                if MITER = 2,
C            LENLS = 6*NEQ                           if MITER = 3 or 4,
C            LENLS = 3*NEQ                           if MITER = 9.
C          (See the MF description for METH and MITER, and the
C          list of optional inputs for MAXL and KMP.)
C          LWP = length of real user work space for preconditioning
C          (see JAC/PSOL).
C          Thus if default values are used and NEQ is constant,
C          this length is:
C             20 + 16*NEQ + 3*NG           for MF = 10,
C             45 + 24*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 11,
C             61 + 24*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 12,
C             20 + 22*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 13 or 14,
C             20 + 19*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 19,
C             20 + 9*NEQ + 3*NG            for MF = 20,
C             45 + 17*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 21,
C             61 + 17*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 22,
C             20 + 15*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 23 or 24,
C             20 + 12*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 29.
C          The first 20 words of RWORK are reserved for conditional
C          and optional inputs and optional outputs.
C
C          The following word in RWORK is a conditional input:
C            RWORK(1) = TCRIT = critical value of t which the solver
C                       is not to overshoot.  Required if ITASK is
C                       4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  (See ITASK.)
C
C LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C IWORK  = an integer work array.  The length of IWORK must be at least
C             30                 if MITER = 0 (MF = 10 or 20),
C             30 + MAXL + LIWP   if MITER = 1 (MF = 11, 21),
C             30 + LIWP          if MITER = 2, 3, 4, or 9.
C          MAXL = 5 unless a different optional input value is given.
C          LIWP = length of integer user work space for preconditioning
C          (see conditional input list following).
C          The first few words of IWORK are used for conditional and
C          optional inputs and optional outputs.
C
C          The following 4 words in IWORK are conditional inputs,
C          required if MITER .ge. 1:
C          IWORK(1) = LWP  = length of real array WP for use in
C                     preconditioning (part of RWORK array).
C          IWORK(2) = LIWP = length of integer array IWP for use in
C                     preconditioning (part of IWORK array).
C                     The arrays WP and IWP are work arrays under the
C                     user's control, for use in the routines that
C                     perform preconditioning operations (JAC and PSOL).
C          IWORK(3) = JPRE = preconditioner type flag:
C                   = 0 for no preconditioning (P1 = P2 = P = identity)
C                   = 1 for left-only preconditioning (P2 = identity)
C                   = 2 for right-only preconditioning (P1 = identity)
C                   = 3 for two-sided preconditioning (and PCG or PCGS)
C          IWORK(4) = JACFLG = flag for whether JAC is called.
C                   = 0 if JAC is not to be called,
C                   = 1 if JAC is to be called.
C                     Use JACFLG = 1 if JAC computes any nonconstant
C                     data needed in preconditioning operations,
C                     such as some of the Jacobian elements.
C
C LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C Note:  The work arrays must not be altered between calls to DLSODKR
C for the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and
C optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
C The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
C available for use by the user outside DLSODKR between calls, if
C desired (but not for use by any of the user-supplied routines).
C
C JAC    = the name of the user-supplied routine to compute any
C          Jacobian elements (or approximations) involved in the
C          matrix preconditioning operations (MITER .ge. 1).
C          It is to have the form
C            SUBROUTINE JAC (F, NEQ, T, Y, YSV, REWT, FTY, V,
C           1                HL0, JOK, WP, IWP, IER)
C            DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YSV(*), REWT(*), FTY(*), V(*),
C           1                 HL0, WP(*)
C            INTEGER IWP(*)
C          This routine must evaluate and preprocess any parts of the
C          Jacobian matrix df/dy used in the preconditioners P1, P2, P.
C          The Y and FTY arrays contain the current values of y and
C          f(t,y), respectively, and the YSV array also contains
C          the current y vector.  The array V is work space of length
C          NEQ for use by JAC.  REWT is the array of reciprocal error
C          weights (1/EWT).  JAC must multiply all computed Jacobian
C          elements by the scalar -HL0, add the identity matrix, and do
C          any factorization operations called for, in preparation
C          for solving linear systems with a coefficient matrix of
C          P1, P2, or P.  The matrix P1*P2 or P should be an
C          approximation to  identity - hl0 * (df/dy).  JAC should
C          return IER = 0 if successful, and IER .ne. 0 if not.
C          (If IER .ne. 0, a smaller time step will be tried.)
C          The arrays WP (of length LWP) and IWP (of length LIWP)
C          are for use by JAC and PSOL for work space and for storage
C          of data needed for the solution of the preconditioner
C          linear systems.  Their lengths and contents are under the
C          user's control.
C               The argument JOK is an input flag for optional use
C          by JAC in deciding whether to recompute Jacobian elements
C          or use saved values.  If JOK = -1, then JAC must compute
C          any relevant Jacobian elements (or approximations) used in
C          the preconditioners.  Optionally, JAC may also save these
C          elements for later reuse.  If JOK = 1, the integrator has
C          made a judgement (based on the convergence history and the
C          value of HL0) that JAC need not recompute Jacobian elements,
C          but instead use saved values, and the current value of HL0,
C          to reconstruct the preconditioner matrices, followed by
C          any required factorizations.  This may be cost-effective if
C          Jacobian elements are costly and storage is available.
C               JAC may alter Y and V, but not YSV, REWT, FTY, or HL0.
C          JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
C               Subroutine JAC may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in JAC) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
C
C PSOL   = the name of the user-supplied routine for the
C          solution of preconditioner linear systems.
C          It is to have the form
C            SUBROUTINE PSOL (NEQ, T, Y, FTY, WK,HL0, WP,IWP, B, LR,IER)
C            DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), FTY(*), WK(*), HL0, WP(*), B(*)
C            INTEGER IWP(*)
C          This routine must solve a linear system with B as right-hand
C          side and one of the preconditioning matrices, P1, P2, or P,
C          as coefficient matrix, and return the solution vector in B.
C          LR is a flag concerning left vs right preconditioning, input
C          to PSOL.  PSOL is to use P1 if LR = 1 and P2 if LR = 2.
C          In the case of the PCG or PCGS method, LR will be 3, and PSOL
C          should solve the system P*x = B with the preconditioner P.
C          In the case MITER = 9 (no Krylov iteration), LR will be 0,
C          and PSOL is to return in B the desired approximate solution
C          to A * x = B, where A = identity - hl0 * (df/dy).
C          PSOL can use data generated in the JAC routine and stored in
C          WP and IWP.
C          The Y and FTY arrays contain the current values of y and
C          f(t,y), respectively.  The array WK is work space of length
C          NEQ for use by PSOL.
C          The argument HL0 is the current value of the scalar appearing
C          in the linear system.  If the old value, as of the last
C          JAC call, is needed, it must have been saved by JAC in WP.
C          On return, PSOL should set the error flag IER as follows:
C            IER = 0 if PSOL was successful,
C            IER .gt. 0 on a recoverable error, meaning that the
C                   time step will be retried,
C            IER .lt. 0 on an unrecoverable error, meaning that the
C                   solver is to stop immediately.
C          PSOL may not alter Y, FTY, or HL0.
C          PSOL must be declared External in the calling program.
C               Subroutine PSOL may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in PSOL) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
C
C MF     = the method flag.  Used only for input.  The legal values of
C          MF are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 29.
C          MF has decimal digits METH and MITER: MF = 10*METH + MITER.
C          METH indicates the basic linear multistep method:
C            METH = 1 means the implicit Adams method.
C            METH = 2 means the method based on Backward
C                     Differentiation Formulas (BDFs).
C          MITER indicates the corrector iteration method:
C            MITER = 0 means functional iteration (no linear system
C                      is involved).
C            MITER = 1 means Newton iteration with Scaled Preconditioned
C                      Incomplete Orthogonalization Method (SPIOM)
C                      for the linear systems.
C            MITER = 2 means Newton iteration with Scaled Preconditioned
C                      Incomplete Generalized Minimal Residual method
C                      (SPIGMR) for the linear systems.
C            MITER = 3 means Newton iteration with Preconditioned
C                      Conjugate Gradient method (PCG)
C                      for the linear systems.
C            MITER = 4 means Newton iteration with scaled preconditioned
C                      Conjugate Gradient method (PCGS)
C                      for the linear systems.
C            MITER = 9 means Newton iteration with only the
C                      user-supplied PSOL routine called (no Krylov
C                      iteration) for the linear systems.
C                      JPRE is ignored, and PSOL is called with LR = 0.
C          See comments in the introduction about the choice of MITER.
C          If MITER .ge. 1, the user must supply routines JAC and PSOL
C          (the names are arbitrary) as described above.
C          For MITER = 0, a dummy argument can be used.
C
C G      = the name of subroutine for constraint functions, whose
C          roots are desired during the integration.  It is to have
C          the form
C               SUBROUTINE G (NEQ, T, Y, NG, GOUT)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), GOUT(NG)
C          where NEQ, T, Y, and NG are input, and the array GOUT
C          is output.  NEQ, T, and Y have the same meaning as in
C          the F routine, and GOUT is an array of length NG.
C          For i = 1,...,NG, this routine is to load into GOUT(i)
C          the value at (t,y) of the i-th constraint function g(i).
C          DLSODKR will find roots of the g(i) of odd multiplicity
C          (i.e. sign changes) as they occur during the integration.
C          G must be declared External in the calling program.
C
C          Caution: Because of numerical errors in the functions
C          g(i) due to roundoff and integration error, DLSODKR may
C          return false roots, or return the same root at two or more
C          nearly equal values of t.  If such false roots are
C          suspected, the user should consider smaller error tolerances
C          and/or higher precision in the evaluation of the g(i).
C
C          If a root of some g(i) defines the end of the problem,
C          the input to DLSODKR should nevertheless allow integration
C          to a point slightly past that root, so that DLSODKR can
C          locate the root by interpolation.
C
C          Subroutine G may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in G) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
C
C NG     = number of constraint functions g(i).  If there are none,
C          set NG = 0, and pass a dummy name for G.
C
C JROOT  = integer array of length NG.  Used only for output.
C          On a return with ISTATE = 3 (one or more roots found),
C          JROOT(i) = 1 if g(i) has a root at t, or JROOT(i) = 0 if not.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Inputs.
C
C The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
C call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
C this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
C location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
C The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
C case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
C of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
C Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
C locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
C then set those of interest to nonzero values.
C
C Name    Location      Meaning and Default Value
C
C H0      RWORK(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
C                   The default value is determined by the solver.
C
C HMAX    RWORK(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is infinite.
C
C HMIN    RWORK(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
C                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
C                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
C
C DELT    RWORK(8)  convergence test constant in Krylov iteration
C                   algorithm.  The default is .05.
C
C MAXORD  IWORK(5)  the maximum order to be allowed.  The default
C                   value is 12 if METH = 1, and 5 if METH = 2.
C                   If MAXORD exceeds the default value, it will
C                   be reduced to the default value.
C                   If MAXORD is changed during the problem, it may
C                   cause the current order to be reduced.
C
C MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
C                   allowed during one call to the solver.
C                   The default value is 500.
C
C MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
C                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
C                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
C                   value.  The default value is 10.
C
C MAXL    IWORK(8)  maximum number of iterations in the SPIOM, SPIGMR,
C                   PCG, or PCGS algorithm (.le. NEQ).
C                   The default is MAXL = MIN(5,NEQ).
C
C KMP     IWORK(9)  number of vectors on which orthogonalization
C                   is done in SPIOM or SPIGMR algorithm (.le. MAXL).
C                   The default is KMP = MAXL.
C                   Note:  When KMP .lt. MAXL and MF = 22, the length
C                          of RWORK must be defined accordingly.  See
C                          the definition of RWORK above.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Outputs.
C
C As optional additional output from DLSODKR, the variables listed
C below are quantities related to the performance of DLSODKR
C which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
C the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
C Except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
C on any successful return from DLSODKR, and on any return with
C ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, -6, or -7.  On an illegal input return
C (ISTATE = -3), they will be unchanged from their existing values
C (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
C On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
C as noted below.
C
C Name    Location      Meaning
C
C HU      RWORK(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
C
C HCUR    RWORK(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
C
C TCUR    RWORK(13) the current value of the independent variable
C                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
C                   current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
C                   will always be at least as far as the argument
C                   T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
C
C TOLSF   RWORK(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
C                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
C                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
C                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
C                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
C                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
C                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
C                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
C                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
C
C NGE     IWORK(10) the number of g evaluations for the problem so far.
C
C NST     IWORK(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
C
C NFE     IWORK(12) the number of f evaluations for the problem so far.
C
C NPE     IWORK(13) the number of calls to JAC so far (for evaluation
C                   of preconditioners).
C
C NQU     IWORK(14) the method order last used (successfully).
C
C NQCUR   IWORK(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.
C
C IMXER   IWORK(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
C                   the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
C                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
C
C LENRW   IWORK(17) the length of RWORK actually required.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C LENIW   IWORK(18) the length of IWORK actually required.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C NNI     IWORK(19) number of nonlinear iterations so far (each of
C                   which calls an iterative linear solver).
C
C NLI     IWORK(20) number of linear iterations so far.
C                   Note: A measure of the success of algorithm is
C                   the average number of linear iterations per
C                   nonlinear iteration, given by NLI/NNI.
C                   If this is close to MAXL, MAXL may be too small.
C
C NPS     IWORK(21) number of preconditioning solve operations
C                   (PSOL calls) so far.
C
C NCFN    IWORK(22) number of convergence failures of the nonlinear
C                   (Newton) iteration so far.
C                   Note: A measure of success is the overall
C                   rate of nonlinear convergence failures, NCFN/NST.
C
C NCFL    IWORK(23) number of convergence failures of the linear
C                   iteration so far.
C                   Note: A measure of success is the overall
C                   rate of linear convergence failures, NCFL/NNI.
C
C NSFI    IWORK(24) number of functional iteration steps so far.
C                   Note: A measure of the extent to which the

C
C NJEV    IWORK(25) number of JAC calls with JOK = -1 so far
C                   (number of evaluations of Jacobian data).
C
C The following two arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
C may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
C For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
C its base address in RWORK, and its description.
C
C Name    Base Address      Description
C
C YH      21 + 3*NG      the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
C                        (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
C                        of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
C                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
C                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
C                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
C                        evaluated at t = TCUR.
C
C ACOR     LENRW-NEQ+1   array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
C                        corrections on each step, scaled on output
C                        to represent the estimated local error in y
C                        on the last step.  This is the vector E in
C                        the description of the error control.  It is
C                        defined only on a successful return from
C                        DLSODKR.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.
C
C The following are optional calls which the user may make to
C gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSODKR.
C (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
C SLATEC error handling package.)
C
C     Form of Call                  Function
C   CALL XSETUN(LUN)          Set the logical unit number, LUN, for
C                             output of messages from DLSODKR, if
C                             the default is not desired.
C                             The default value of LUN is 6.
C
C   CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         Set a flag to control the printing of
C                             messages by DLSODKR.
C                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger:
C                             This risks losing valuable information.)
C                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).
C
C                             Either of the above calls may be made at
C                             any time and will take effect immediately.
C
C   CALL DSRCKR(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) saves and restores the contents of
C                             the internal Common blocks used by
C                             DLSODKR (see Part 3 below).
C                             RSAV must be a real array of length 228
C                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
C                             array of length 63 or more.
C                             JOB=1 means save Common into RSAV/ISAV.
C                             JOB=2 means restore Common from RSAV/ISAV.
C                                DSRCKR is useful if one is
C                             interrupting a run and restarting
C                             later, or alternating between two or
C                             more problems solved with DLSODKR.
C
C   CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        Provide derivatives of y, of various
C        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
C                             desired.  It may be called only after
C                             a successful return from DLSODKR.
C
C The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.
C The form of the call is:
C
C   LYH = 21 + 3*NG
C   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(LYH), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
C
C The input parameters are:
C
C T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
C             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODKR).
C             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
C             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
C K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
C             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
C             (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
C             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(T), is already provided
C             by DLSODKR directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
C             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
C LYH       = 21 + 3*NG = base address in RWORK of the history array YH.
C NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
C
C The output parameters are:
C
C DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
C             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
C IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
C             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
C             On an error return, a message is also written.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 3.  Common Blocks.
C
C If DLSODKR is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
C must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
C   (1) the call sequence to DLSODKR, and
C   (2) the four internal Common blocks
C         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
C                      followed by 37 integer words),
C         /DLS002/  of length   5  (1 double precision word
C                      followed by  4 integer words),
C         /DLPK01/  of length  17  (4 double precision words
C                      followed by 13 integer words),
C         /DLSR01/  of length  14     (5 double precision words
C                      followed by  9 integer words).
C
C If DLSODKR is used on a system in which the contents of internal
C Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
C declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure
C that their contents are preserved.
C
C If the solution of a given problem by DLSODKR is to be interrupted
C and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
C or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
C following the return from the last DLSODKR call prior to the
C interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
C internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
C next DLSODKR call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
C blocks, use Subroutine DSRCKR (see Part 2 above).
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
C
C Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSODKR package which
C relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
C replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
C a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
C done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
C (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
C superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
C
C (a) DEWSET.
C The following subroutine is called just before each internal
C integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
C described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
C     SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
C where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODKR call sequence,
C YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
C EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
C
C If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
C (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
C in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the DVNORM
C routine (see below), and also used by DLSODKR in the computation
C of the optional output IMXER, the diagonal Jacobian approximation,
C and the increments for difference quotient Jacobians.
C
C In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
C the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
C are available from the history array YH, described above under
C optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
C extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
C factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
C given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
C NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
C can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
C     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
C     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
C     NQ = ILS(33)
C     NST = ILS(34)
C     H = RLS(212)
C Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
C YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
C unnecessary when NST = 0).
C
C (b) DVNORM.
C The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
C root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
C     D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
C where:
C   N = the length of the vector,
C   V = real array of length N containing the vector,
C   W = real array of length N containing weights,
C   D = SQRT( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
C DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
C EWT is as set by Subroutine DEWSET.
C
C If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
C value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSODKR.
C None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
C For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
C   -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*W(i)) for the RMS-norm, or
C   -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
C    suppressing the error control on those components of y.

C         (Implicit form).
C
C This version is in double precision.
C
C DLSODI solves the initial value problem for linearly implicit
C systems of first order ODEs,
C     A(t,y) * dy/dt = g(t,y) ,  where A(t,y) is a square matrix,
C or, in component form,
C     ( a   * ( dy / dt ))  + ... +  ( a     * ( dy   / dt ))  =

C Summary of Usage.
C
C Communication between the user and the DLSODI package, for normal
C situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
C of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
C details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
C and instructions for special situations.  See also the example
C problem (with program and output) following this summary.
C
C A. First, provide a subroutine of the form:
C               SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, S, R, IRES)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), R(*)
C which computes the residual function
C     r = g(t,y)  -  A(t,y) * s ,
C as a function of t and the vectors y and s.  (s is an internally
C generated approximation to dy/dt.)  The arrays Y and S are inputs
C to the RES routine and should not be altered.  The residual
C vector is to be stored in the array R.  The argument IRES should be
C ignored for casual use of DLSODI.  (For uses of IRES, see the
C paragraph on RES in the full description below.)
C
C B. Next, decide whether full or banded form is more economical
C for the storage of matrices.  DLSODI must deal internally with the
C matrices A and dr/dy, where r is the residual function defined above.
C DLSODI generates a linear combination of these two matrices, and
C this is treated in either full or banded form.
C     The matrix structure is communicated by a method flag MF,
C which is 21 or 22 for the full case, and 24 or 25 in the band case.
C     In the banded case, DLSODI requires two half-bandwidth
C parameters ML and MU.  These are, respectively, the widths of the
C lower and upper parts of the band, excluding the main diagonal.
C Thus the band consists of the locations (i,j) with
C i-ML .le. j .le. i+MU, and the full bandwidth is ML+MU+1.
C Note that the band must accommodate the nonzero elements of
C A(t,y), dg/dy, and d(A*s)/dy (s fixed).  Alternatively, one
C can define a band that encloses only the elements that are relatively
C large in magnitude, and gain some economy in storage and possibly
C also efficiency, although the appropriate threshhold for
C retaining matrix elements is highly problem-dependent.
C
C C. You must also provide a subroutine of the form:
C               SUBROUTINE ADDA (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, P, NROWP)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), P(NROWP,*)
C which adds the matrix A = A(t,y) to the contents of the array P.
C T and the Y array are input and should not be altered.
C     In the full matrix case, this routine should add elements of
C to P in the usual order.  I.e., add A(i,j) to P(i,j).  (Ignore the
C ML and MU arguments in this case.)
C     In the band matrix case, this routine should add element A(i,j)
C to P(i-j+MU+1,j).  I.e., add the diagonal lines of A to the rows of
C P from the top down (the top line of A added to the first row of P).
C
C D. For the sake of efficiency, you are encouraged to supply the
C Jacobian matrix dr/dy in closed form, where r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*s
C (s = a fixed vector) as above.  If dr/dy is being supplied,
C use MF = 21 or 24, and provide a subroutine of the form:
C               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, S, ML, MU, P, NROWP)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), P(NROWP,*)
C which computes dr/dy as a function of t, y, and s.  Here T, Y, and
C S are inputs, and the routine is to load dr/dy into P as follows:
C     In the full matrix case (MF = 21), load P(i,j) with dr(i)/dy(j),
C the partial derivative of r(i) with respect to y(j).  (Ignore the
C ML and MU arguments in this case.)
C     In the band matrix case (MF = 24), load P(i-j+mu+1,j) with
C dr(i)/dy(j), i.e. load the diagonal lines of dr/dy into the rows of
C P from the top down.
C     In either case, only nonzero elements need be loaded, and the
C indexing of P is the same as in the ADDA routine.
C     Note that if A is independent of y (or this dependence
C is weak enough to be ignored) then JAC is to compute dg/dy.
C     If it is not feasible to provide a JAC routine, use
C MF = 22 or 25, and DLSODI will compute an approximate Jacobian
C internally by difference quotients.
C
C E. Next decide whether or not to provide the initial value of the
C derivative vector dy/dt.  If the initial value of A(t,y) is
C nonsingular (and not too ill-conditioned), you may let DLSODI compute
C this vector (ISTATE = 0).  (DLSODI will solve the system A*s = g for
C s, with initial values of A and g.)  If A(t,y) is initially
C singular, then the system is a differential-algebraic system, and
C you must make use of the particular form of the system to compute the
C initial values of y and dy/dt.  In that case, use ISTATE = 1 and
C load the initial value of dy/dt into the array YDOTI.
C The input array YDOTI and the initial Y array must be consistent with
C the equations A*dy/dt = g.  This implies that the initial residual
C r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*YDOTI  must be approximately zero.
C
C F. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODI once for
C each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
C for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
C by DLSODI.  On the first call to DLSODI, supply arguments as follows:
C RES    = name of user subroutine for residual function r.
C ADDA   = name of user subroutine for computing and adding A(t,y).
C JAC    = name of user subroutine for Jacobian matrix dr/dy
C          (MF = 21 or 24).  If not used, pass a dummy name.
C Note: the names for the RES and ADDA routines and (if used) the
C        JAC routine must be declared External in the calling program.
C NEQ    = number of scalar equations in the system.
C Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
C YDOTI  = array of length NEQ (containing initial dy/dt if ISTATE = 1).
C T      = the initial value of the independent variable.
C TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
C ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
C RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
C ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
C          the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
C          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
C          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
C          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
C          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
C          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
C          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
C          control.  Caution: Actual (global) errors may exceed these
C          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
C ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
C ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1 if the
C          initial dy/dt is supplied, and 0 otherwise.
C IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
C RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
C             22 +  9*NEQ + NEQ**2           for MF = 21 or 22,
C             22 + 10*NEQ + (2*ML + MU)*NEQ  for MF = 24 or 25.
C LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
C IWORK  = integer work array of length at least 20 + NEQ.
C          If MF = 24 or 25, input in IWORK(1),IWORK(2) the lower
C          and upper half-bandwidths ML,MU.
C LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension).
C MF     = method flag.  Standard values are:
C          21 for a user-supplied full Jacobian.
C          22 for an internally generated full Jacobian.
C          24 for a user-supplied banded Jacobian.
C          25 for an internally generated banded Jacobian.
C          for other choices of MF, see the paragraph on MF in
C          the full description below.
C Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, YDOTI, RWORK, IWORK,
C and possibly ATOL.
C
C G. The output from the first call (or any call) is:
C      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
C      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
C ISTATE = 2  if DLSODI was successful, negative otherwise.
C          -1 means excess work done on this call (check all inputs).
C          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
C          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
C          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
C          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian
C             supplied or wrong choice of tolerances).
C          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
C             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
C          -7 cannot occur in casual use.
C          -8 means DLSODI was unable to compute the initial dy/dt.
C             In casual use, this means A(t,y) is initially singular.
C             Supply YDOTI and use ISTATE = 1 on the first call.
C
C  If DLSODI returns ISTATE = -1, -4, or -5, then the output of
C  DLSODI also includes YDOTI = array containing residual vector
C  r = g - A * dy/dt  evaluated at the current t, y, and dy/dt.
C
C H. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
C reset TOUT and call DLSODI again.  No other parameters need be reset.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Example Problem.
C
C The following is a simple example problem, with the coding
C needed for its solution by DLSODI.  The problem is from chemical
C kinetics, and consists of the following three equations:
C     dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.e4*y2*y3
C     dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.e4*y2*y3 - 3.e7*y2**2
C       0.   = y1 + y2 + y3 - 1.
C on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.e10, with initial conditions
C y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0.
C
C The following coding solves this problem with DLSODI, using MF = 21
C and printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.e10.  It uses
C ITOL = 2 and ATOL much smaller for y2 than y1 or y3 because
C y2 has much smaller values.  dy/dt is supplied in YDOTI. We had
C obtained the initial value of dy3/dt by differentiating the
C third equation and evaluating the first two at t = 0.
C At the end of the run, statistical quantities of interest are
C printed (see optional outputs in the full description below).

C Full Description of User Interface to DLSODI.
C
C The user interface to DLSODI consists of the following parts.
C
C 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODI, which is a driver
C      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
C      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
C      Following these descriptions is a description of
C      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
C      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
C
C 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODI package that may be
C      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
C      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
C      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
C
C 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
C      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
C      of the problem and continued solution later.
C
C 4.   Description of two routines in the DLSODI package, either of
C      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
C      These relate to the measurement of errors.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 1.  Call Sequence.
C
C The call sequence parameters used for input only are
C     RES, ADDA, JAC, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK,
C     IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
C and those used for both input and output are
C     Y, T, ISTATE, YDOTI.
C The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
C optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
C to the return from Subroutine DLSODI to the user's calling program.)
C
C The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
C initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
C change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
C
C The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
C
C RES    = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which supplies
C          the residual vector for the ODE system, defined by
C            r = g(t,y) - A(t,y) * s
C          as a function of the scalar t and the vectors
C          s and y (s approximates dy/dt).  This subroutine
C          is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, S, R, IRES)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), R(*)
C          where NEQ, T, Y, S, and IRES are input, and R and
C          IRES are output.  Y, S, and R are arrays of length NEQ.
C             On input, IRES indicates how DLSODI will use the
C          returned array R, as follows:
C             IRES = 1  means that DLSODI needs the full residual,
C                       r = g - A*s, exactly.
C             IRES = -1 means that DLSODI is using R only to compute
C                       the Jacobian dr/dy by difference quotients.
C          The RES routine can ignore IRES, or it can omit some terms
C          if IRES = -1.  If A does not depend on y, then RES can
C          just return R = g when IRES = -1.  If g - A*s contains other
C          additive terms that are independent of y, these can also be
C          dropped, if done consistently, when IRES = -1.
C             The subroutine should set the flag IRES if it
C          encounters a halt condition or illegal input.
C          Otherwise, it should not reset IRES.  On output,
C             IRES = 1 or -1 represents a normal return, and
C          DLSODI continues integrating the ODE.  Leave IRES
C          unchanged from its input value.
C             IRES = 2 tells DLSODI to immediately return control
C          to the calling program, with ISTATE = 3.  This lets
C          the calling program change parameters of the problem,
C          if necessary.
C             IRES = 3 represents an error condition (for example, an
C          illegal value of y).  DLSODI tries to integrate the system
C          without getting IRES = 3 from RES.  If it cannot, DLSODI
C          returns with ISTATE = -7 or -1.
C             On an DLSODI return with ISTATE = 3, -1, or -7, the values
C          of T and Y returned correspond to the last point reached
C          successfully without getting the flag IRES = 2 or 3.
C             The flag values IRES = 2 and 3 should not be used to
C          handle switches or root-stop conditions.  This is better
C          done by calling DLSODI in a one-step mode and checking the
C          stopping function for a sign change at each step.
C             If quantities computed in the RES routine are needed
C          externally to DLSODI, an extra call to RES should be made
C          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
C          To get the current dy/dt for the S argument, use DINTDY.
C             RES must be declared External in the calling
C          program.  See note below for more about RES.
C
C ADDA   = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which adds the
C          matrix A = A(t,y) to another matrix stored in the same form
C          as A.  The storage form is determined by MITER (see MF).
C          This subroutine is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE ADDA (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, P, NROWP)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), P(NROWP,*)
C          where NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, and NROWP are input and P is
C          output.  Y is an array of length NEQ, and the matrix P is
C          stored in an NROWP by NEQ array.
C             In the full matrix case ( MITER = 1 or 2) ADDA should
C          add  A    to P(i,j).  ML and MU are ignored.
C                i,j
C             In the band matrix case ( MITER = 4 or 5) ADDA should
C          add  A    to  P(i-j+MU+1,j).
C                i,j
C          See JAC for details on this band storage form.
C             ADDA must be declared External in the calling program.
C          See note below for more information about ADDA.
C
C JAC    = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which supplies the
C          Jacobian matrix, dr/dy, where r = g - A*s.  The form of the
C          Jacobian matrix is determined by MITER.  JAC is required
C          if MITER = 1 or 4 -- otherwise a dummy name can be
C          passed.  This subroutine is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE JAC ( NEQ, T, Y, S, ML, MU, P, NROWP )
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), P(NROWP,*)
C          where NEQ, T, Y, S, ML, MU, and NROWP are input and P
C          is output.  Y and S are arrays of length NEQ, and the
C          matrix P is stored in an NROWP by NEQ array.
C          P is to be loaded with partial derivatives (elements
C          of the Jacobian matrix) on output.
C             In the full matrix case (MITER = 1), ML and MU
C          are ignored and the Jacobian is to be loaded into P
C          by columns-- i.e., dr(i)/dy(j) is loaded into P(i,j).
C             In the band matrix case (MITER = 4), the elements
C          within the band are to be loaded into P by columns,
C          with diagonal lines of dr/dy loaded into the
C          rows of P.  Thus dr(i)/dy(j) is to be loaded
C          into P(i-j+MU+1,j).  The locations in P in the two
C          triangular areas which correspond to nonexistent matrix
C          elements can be ignored or loaded arbitrarily, as they
C          they are overwritten by DLSODI.  ML and MU are the
C          half-bandwidth parameters (see IWORK).
C               In either case, P is preset to zero by the solver,
C          so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
C          Each call to JAC is preceded by a call to RES with the same
C          arguments NEQ, T, Y, and S.  Thus to gain some efficiency,
C          intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be
C          saved in a user Common block by RES and not recomputed by JAC
C          if desired.  Also, JAC may alter the Y array, if desired.
C               JAC need not provide dr/dy exactly.  A crude
C          approximation (possibly with a smaller bandwidth) will do.
C               JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
C               See note below for more about JAC.
C
C    Note on RES, ADDA, and JAC:
C          These subroutines may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in the subroutines) and/or Y has length
C          exceeding NEQ(1).  However, these routines should not alter
C          NEQ(1), Y(1),...,Y(NEQ) or any other input variables.
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
C
C NEQ    = the size of the system (number of first order ordinary
C          differential equations or scalar algebraic equations).
C          Used only for input.
C          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
C          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
C          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
C          these are to be accessed in RES, ADDA, or JAC.
C
C          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
C          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
C          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
C          (The DLSODI package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
C          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
C          to RES, ADDA, and JAC.  Hence, if it is an array,
C          locations NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data
C          and pass it to RES, ADDA, or JAC.  Each such subroutine
C          must include NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
C
C Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
C          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
C          first call (ISTATE = 0 or 1), and only for output on other
C          calls.  On the first call, Y must contain the vector of
C          initial values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution
C          vector, evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
C          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
C
C          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to RES,
C          ADDA, and JAC.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ,
C          and locations Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real
C          data and pass it to RES, ADDA, or JAC.  (The DLSODI
C          package accesses only Y(1),...,Y(NEQ). )
C
C YDOTI  = a real array for the initial value of the vector
C          dy/dt and for work space, of dimension at least NEQ.
C
C          On input:
C            If ISTATE = 0, then DLSODI will compute the initial value
C          of dy/dt, if A is nonsingular.  Thus YDOTI will
C          serve only as work space and may have any value.
C            If ISTATE = 1, then YDOTI must contain the initial value
C          of dy/dt.
C            If ISTATE = 2 or 3 (continuation calls), then YDOTI
C          may have any value.
C            Note: If the initial value of A is singular, then
C          DLSODI cannot compute the initial value of dy/dt, so
C          it must be provided in YDOTI, with ISTATE = 1.
C
C          On output, when DLSODI terminates abnormally with ISTATE =
C          -1, -4, or -5, YDOTI will contain the residual
C          r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*(dy/dt).  If r is large, t is near
C          its initial value, and YDOTI is supplied with ISTATE = 1,
C          then there may have been an incorrect input value of
C          YDOTI = dy/dt, or the problem (as given to DLSODI)
C          may not have a solution.
C
C          If desired, the YDOTI array may be used for other
C          purposes between calls to the solver.
C
C T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
C          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
C          On output, after each call, T is the value at which a
C          computed solution Y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
C          on an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
C
C TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
C          Used only for input.
C
C          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 0 or 1), TOUT may be
C          equal to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next
C          call.  For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is
C          used in order to determine the direction of the integration
C          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
C          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
C          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
C
C          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
C          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
C          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
C
C          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
C          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
C          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
C          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
C          TCUR and HU).
C
C ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
C          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
C
C RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
C          Input only.
C
C ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
C
C             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
C          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
C          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
C          in y, according to an inequality of the form
C                      RMS-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
C          where       EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
C          and the RMS-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
C          RMS-norm(v) = SQRT(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).  Here EWT = (EWT(i))
C          is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
C          the values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
C          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
C          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
C
C             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
C              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              4     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C
C          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
C          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
C
C          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
C          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
C          error controls can be obtained by substituting
C          user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
C          the norm calculation.  See Part 4 below.
C
C          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
C          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
C          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
C          down uniformly.
C
C ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
C          Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
C          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
C          2  means take one step only and return.
C          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
C             beyond t = TOUT and return.
C          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
C             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
C             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
C             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
C          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
C
C          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
C          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
C          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
C          in which case answers at t = TOUT are returned first).
C
C ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
C          state of the calculation.
C
C          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
C          0  means this is the first call for the problem, and
C             DLSODI is to compute the initial value of dy/dt
C             (while doing other initializations).  See note below.
C          1  means this is the first call for the problem, and
C             the initial value of dy/dt has been supplied in
C             YDOTI (DLSODI will do other initializations).  See note
C             below.
C          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
C             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
C             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
C             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
C             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
C             tested for legality.)
C          3  means this is not the first call, and the
C             calculation is to continue normally, but with
C             a change in input parameters other than
C             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
C             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF, ML, MU,
C             and any of the optional inputs except H0.
C             (See IWORK description for ML and MU.)
C          Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
C          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
C          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
C          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
C          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
C          ISTATE = 0 or 1 on input.
C
C          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
C           0 or 1  means nothing was done; TOUT = t and
C              ISTATE = 0 or 1 on input.
C           2  means that the integration was performed successfully.
C           3  means that the user-supplied Subroutine RES signalled
C              DLSODI to halt the integration and return (IRES = 2).
C              Integration as far as T was achieved with no occurrence
C              of IRES = 2, but this flag was set on attempting the
C              next step.
C          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
C              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
C              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
C              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
C              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
C              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
C              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
C              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
C              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
C          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
C              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
C              completing the requested task, but the integration
C              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
C              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
C              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
C              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
C              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
C              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
C          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
C              integration steps.  See written message for details.
C              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
C              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
C              the run to stop.
C          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
C              may be inappropriate.
C          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix.
C          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
C              integration.  pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0)
C              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
C              the integration was successful as far as T.
C          -7  means that the user-supplied Subroutine RES set
C              its error flag (IRES = 3) despite repeated tries by
C              DLSODI to avoid that condition.
C          -8  means that ISTATE was 0 on input but DLSODI was unable
C              to compute the initial value of dy/dt.  See the
C              printed message for details.
C
C          Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
C          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
C          Similarly, ISTATE (= 3) need not be reset if RES told
C          DLSODI to return because the calling program must change
C          the parameters of the problem.
C          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
C          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
C          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
C          calling the solver again.
C
C IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
C          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
C          The optional inputs are listed separately below.
C          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
C                   Default values will be used in all cases.
C          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
C
C RWORK  = a real working array (double precision).
C          The length of RWORK must be at least
C             20 + NYH*(MAXORD + 1) + 3*NEQ + LENWM    where
C          NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
C          MAXORD = 12 (if METH = 1) or 5 (if METH = 2) (unless a
C                   smaller value is given as an optional input),
C          LENWM   = NEQ**2 + 2    if MITER is 1 or 2, and
C          LENWM   = (2*ML+MU+1)*NEQ + 2 if MITER is 4 or 5.
C          (See MF description for the definition of METH and MITER.)
C          Thus if MAXORD has its default value and NEQ is constant,
C          this length is
C             22 + 16*NEQ + NEQ**2         for MF = 11 or 12,
C             22 + 17*NEQ + (2*ML+MU)*NEQ  for MF = 14 or 15,
C             22 +  9*NEQ + NEQ**2         for MF = 21 or 22,
C             22 + 10*NEQ + (2*ML+MU)*NEQ  for MF = 24 or 25.
C          The first 20 words of RWORK are reserved for conditional
C          and optional inputs and optional outputs.
C
C          The following word in RWORK is a conditional input:
C            RWORK(1) = TCRIT = critical value of t which the solver
C                       is not to overshoot.  Required if ITASK is
C                       4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  (See ITASK.)
C
C LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C IWORK  = an integer work array.  The length of IWORK must be at least
C          20 + NEQ .  The first few words of IWORK are used for
C          conditional and optional inputs and optional outputs.
C
C          The following 2 words in IWORK are conditional inputs:
C            IWORK(1) = ML     These are the lower and upper
C            IWORK(2) = MU     half-bandwidths, respectively, of the
C                       matrices in the problem-- the Jacobian dr/dy
C                       and the left-hand side matrix A. These
C                       half-bandwidths exclude the main diagonal,
C                       so the total bandwidth is ML + MU + 1 .
C                       The band is defined by the matrix locations
C                       (i,j) with i-ML .le. j .le. i+MU.  ML and MU
C                       must satisfy  0 .le.  ML,MU  .le. NEQ-1.
C                       These are required if MITER is 4 or 5, and
C                       ignored otherwise.
C                       ML and MU may in fact be the band parameters
C                       for matrices to which dr/dy and A are only
C                       approximately equal.
C
C LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C Note:  The work arrays must not be altered between calls to DLSODI
C for the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and
C optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
C The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
C available for use by the user outside DLSODI between calls, if
C desired (but not for use by RES, ADDA, or JAC).
C
C MF     = the method flag.  Used only for input.  The legal values of
C          MF are 11, 12, 14, 15, 21, 22, 24, and 25.
C          MF has decimal digits METH and MITER: MF = 10*METH + MITER.
C            METH indicates the basic linear multistep method:
C              METH = 1 means the implicit Adams method.
C              METH = 2 means the method based on Backward
C                       Differentiation Formulas (BDFs).
C                The BDF method is strongly preferred for stiff
C              problems, while the Adams method is preferred when
C              the problem is not stiff.  If the matrix A(t,y) is
C              nonsingular, stiffness here can be taken to mean that of
C              the explicit ODE system dy/dt = A-inverse * g.  If A is
C              singular, the concept of stiffness is not well defined.
C                If you do not know whether the problem is stiff, we
C              recommend using METH = 2.  If it is stiff, the advantage
C              of METH = 2 over METH = 1 will be great, while if it is
C              not stiff, the advantage of METH = 1 will be slight.
C              If maximum efficiency is important, some experimentation
C              with METH may be necessary.
C            MITER indicates the corrector iteration method:
C              MITER = 1 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
C                        full (NEQ by NEQ) Jacobian.
C              MITER = 2 means chord iteration with an internally
C                        generated (difference quotient) full Jacobian.
C                        This uses NEQ+1 extra calls to RES per dr/dy
C                        evaluation.
C              MITER = 4 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
C                        banded Jacobian.
C              MITER = 5 means chord iteration with an internally
C                        generated banded Jacobian (using ML+MU+2
C                        extra calls to RES per dr/dy evaluation).
C              If MITER = 1 or 4, the user must supply a Subroutine JAC
C              (the name is arbitrary) as described above under JAC.
C              For other values of MITER, a dummy argument can be used.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Inputs.
C
C The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
C call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
C this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
C location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
C the use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
C case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
C of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
C Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
C locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
C then set those of interest to nonzero values.
C
C Name    Location      Meaning and Default Value
C
C H0      RWORK(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
C                   The default value is determined by the solver.
C
C HMAX    RWORK(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is infinite.
C
C HMIN    RWORK(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
C                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
C                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
C
C MAXORD  IWORK(5)  the maximum order to be allowed.  The default
C                   value is 12 if METH = 1, and 5 if METH = 2.
C                   If MAXORD exceeds the default value, it will
C                   be reduced to the default value.
C                   If MAXORD is changed during the problem, it may
C                   cause the current order to be reduced.
C
C MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
C                   allowed during one call to the solver.
C                   The default value is 500.
C
C MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
C                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
C                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
C                   value.  The default value is 10.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Outputs.
C
C As optional additional output from DLSODI, the variables listed
C below are quantities related to the performance of DLSODI
C which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
C the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
C Except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
C on any successful return from DLSODI, and on any return with
C ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, -6, or -7.  On a return with -3 (illegal
C input) or -8, they will be unchanged from their existing values
C (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
C On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
C as noted below.
C
C Name    Location      Meaning
C
C HU      RWORK(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
C
C HCUR    RWORK(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
C
C TCUR    RWORK(13) the current value of the independent variable
C                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
C                   current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
C                   will always be at least as far as the argument
C                   T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
C
C TOLSF   RWORK(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
C                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
C                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
C                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
C                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
C                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
C                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
C                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
C                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
C
C NST     IWORK(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
C
C NRE     IWORK(12) the number of residual evaluations (RES calls)
C                   for the problem so far.
C
C NJE     IWORK(13) the number of Jacobian evaluations (each involving
C                   an evaluation of A and dr/dy) for the problem so
C                   far.  This equals the number of calls to ADDA and
C                   (if MITER = 1 or 4) JAC, and the number of matrix
C                   LU decompositions.
C
C NQU     IWORK(14) the method order last used (successfully).
C
C NQCUR   IWORK(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.
C
C IMXER   IWORK(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
C                   the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
C                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
C
C LENRW   IWORK(17) the length of RWORK actually required.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C LENIW   IWORK(18) the length of IWORK actually required.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C
C The following two arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
C may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
C For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
C its base address in RWORK, and its description.
C
C Name    Base Address      Description
C
C YH      21             the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
C                        (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
C                        of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
C                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
C                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
C                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
C                        evaluated at t = TCUR.
C
C ACOR     LENRW-NEQ+1   array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
C                        corrections on each step, scaled on output to
C                        represent the estimated local error in y on the
C                        last step. This is the vector E in the descrip-
C                        tion of the error control.  It is defined only
C                        on a return from DLSODI with ISTATE = 2.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.
C
C The following are optional calls which the user may make to
C gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSODI.
C (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
C SLATEC error handling package.)
C
C     Form of Call                  Function
C   CALL XSETUN(LUN)          Set the logical unit number, LUN, for
C                             output of messages from DLSODI, if
C                             the default is not desired.
C                             The default value of LUN is 6.
C
C   CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         Set a flag to control the printing of
C                             messages by DLSODI.
C                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger:
C                             This risks losing valuable information.)
C                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).
C
C                             Either of the above calls may be made at
C                             any time and will take effect immediately.
C
C   CALL DSRCOM(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) saves and restores the contents of
C                             the internal Common blocks used by
C                             DLSODI (see Part 3 below).
C                             RSAV must be a real array of length 218
C                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
C                             array of length 37 or more.
C                             JOB=1 means save Common into RSAV/ISAV.
C                             JOB=2 means restore Common from RSAV/ISAV.
C                                DSRCOM is useful if one is
C                             interrupting a run and restarting
C                             later, or alternating between two or
C                             more problems solved with DLSODI.
C
C   CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        Provide derivatives of y, of various
C        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
C                             desired.  It may be called only after
C                             a successful return from DLSODI.
C
C The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.
C The form of the call is:
C
C   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(21), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
C
C The input parameters are:
C
C T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
C             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODI).
C             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
C             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
C K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
C             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
C             (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
C             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(T), is already provided
C             by DLSODI directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
C             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
C RWORK(21) = the base address of the history array YH.
C NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
C
C The output parameters are:
C
C DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
C             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
C IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
C             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
C             On an error return, a message is also written.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 3.  Common Blocks.
C
C If DLSODI is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
C must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
C   (1) the call sequence to DLSODI, and
C   (2) the internal Common block
C         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
C                      followed by 37 integer words),
C
C If DLSODI is used on a system in which the contents of internal
C Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
C declare the above Common block in the calling program to insure
C that their contents are preserved.
C
C If the solution of a given problem by DLSODI is to be interrupted
C and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
C or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
C following the return from the last DLSODI call prior to the
C interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
C internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
C next DLSODI call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
C blocks, use Subroutine DSRCOM (see Part 2 above).
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
C
C Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSODI package which
C relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
C replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
C a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
C done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
C (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
C superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
C
C (a) DEWSET.
C The following subroutine is called just before each internal
C integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
C described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
C     SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
C where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODI call sequence,
C YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
C EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
C
C If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
C (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
C in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the DVNORM
C routine (see below), and also used by DLSODI in the computation
C of the optional output IMXER, the diagonal Jacobian approximation,
C and the increments for difference quotient Jacobians.
C
C In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
C the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
C are available from the history array YH, described above under
C optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
C extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
C factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
C given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
C NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
C can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
C     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
C     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
C     NQ = ILS(33)
C     NST = ILS(34)
C     H = RLS(212)
C Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
C YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
C unnecessary when NST = 0).
C
C (b) DVNORM.
C The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
C root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
C     D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
C where:
C   N = the length of the vector,
C   V = real array of length N containing the vector,
C   W = real array of length N containing weights,
C   D = SQRT( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
C DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
C EWT is as set by Subroutine DEWSET.
C
C If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
C value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSODI.
C None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
C For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
C   -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*W(i)) for the RMS-norm, or
C   -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
C    suppressing the error control on those components of y.

C          in Implicit form, with Block-Tridiagonal Jacobian treatment.
C
C This version is in double precision.
C
C DLSOIBT solves the initial value problem for linearly implicit
C systems of first order ODEs,
C     A(t,y) * dy/dt = g(t,y) ,  where A(t,y) is a square matrix,
C or, in component form,
C     ( a   * ( dy / dt ))  + ... +  ( a     * ( dy   / dt ))  =

C           i      1   2       NEQ
C
C If A is singular, this is a differential-algebraic system.
C
C DLSOIBT is a variant version of the DLSODI package, for the case where
C the matrices A, dg/dy, and d(A*s)/dy are all block-tridiagonal.

C as a function of t and the vectors y and s.  (s is an internally
C generated approximation to dy/dt.)  The arrays Y and S are inputs
C to the RES routine and should not be altered.  The residual
C vector is to be stored in the array R.  The argument IRES should be
C ignored for casual use of DLSOIBT.  (For uses of IRES, see the
C paragraph on RES in the full description below.)
C
C B. Next, identify the block structure of the matrices A = A(t,y) and
C dr/dy.  DLSOIBT must deal internally with a linear combination, P, of
C these two matrices.  The matrix P (hence both A and dr/dy) must have
C a block-tridiagonal form with fixed structure parameters
C     MB = block size, MB .ge. 1, and
C     NB = number of blocks in each direction, NB .ge. 4,
C with MB*NB = NEQ.  In each of the NB block-rows of the matrix P
C (each consisting of MB consecutive rows), the nonzero elements are
C to lie in three consecutive MB by MB blocks.  In block-rows
C 2 through NB - 1, these are centered about the main diagonal.
C in block-rows 1 and NB, they are the diagonal blocks and the two
C blocks adjacent to the diagonal block.  (Thus block positions (1,3)
C and (NB,NB-2) can be nonzero.)
C Alternatively, P (hence A and dr/dy) may be only approximately
C equal to matrices with this form, and DLSOIBT should still succeed.
C The block-tridiagonal matrix P is described by three arrays,
C each of size MB by MB by NB:
C     PA = array of diagonal blocks,
C     PB = array of superdiagonal (and one subdiagonal) blocks, and
C     PC = array of subdiagonal (and one superdiagonal) blocks.
C Specifically, the three MB by MB blocks in the k-th block-row of P
C are stored in (reading across):
C     PC(*,*,k) = block to the left of the diagonal block,
C     PA(*,*,k) = diagonal block, and
C     PB(*,*,k) = block to the right of the diagonal block,
C except for k = 1, where the three blocks (reading across) are
C     PA(*,*,1) (= diagonal block), PB(*,*,1), and PC(*,*,1),
C and k = NB, where they are
C     PB(*,*,NB), PC(*,*,NB), and PA(*,*,NB) (= diagonal block).
C (Each asterisk * stands for an index that ranges from 1 to MB.)
C
C C. You must also provide a subroutine of the form:
C     SUBROUTINE ADDA (NEQ, T, Y, MB, NB, PA, PB, PC)
C     DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), PA(MB,MB,NB), PB(MB,MB,NB), PC(MB,MB,NB)
C which adds the nonzero blocks of the matrix A = A(t,y) to the
C contents of the arrays PA, PB, and PC, following the structure
C description in Paragraph B above.
C T and the Y array are input and should not be altered.
C Thus the affect of ADDA should be the following:
C     DO 30 K = 1,NB
C       DO 20 J = 1,MB
C         DO 10 I = 1,MB
C           PA(I,J,K) = PA(I,J,K) +
C             ( (I,J) element of K-th diagonal block of A)
C           PB(I,J,K) = PB(I,J,K) +
C             ( (I,J) element of block in block position (K,K+1) of A,
C             or in block position (NB,NB-2) if K = NB)
C           PC(I,J,K) = PC(I,J,K) +
C             ( (I,J) element of block in block position (K,K-1) of A,
C             or in block position (1,3) if K = 1)
C 10        CONTINUE
C 20      CONTINUE
C 30    CONTINUE
C
C D. For the sake of efficiency, you are encouraged to supply the
C Jacobian matrix dr/dy in closed form, where r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*s
C (s = a fixed vector) as above.  If dr/dy is being supplied,
C use MF = 21, and provide a subroutine of the form:
C     SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, S, MB, NB, PA, PB, PC)
C     DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), PA(MB,MB,NB), PB(MB,MB,NB),
C    1                 PC(MB,MB,NB)
C which computes dr/dy as a function of t, y, and s.  Here T, Y, and
C S are inputs, and the routine is to load dr/dy into PA, PB, PC,
C according to the structure description in Paragraph B above.
C That is, load the diagonal blocks into PA, the superdiagonal blocks
C (and block (NB,NB-2) ) into PB, and the subdiagonal blocks (and
C block (1,3) ) into PC.  The blocks in block-row k of dr/dy are to
C be loaded into PA(*,*,k), PB(*,*,k), and PC(*,*,k).
C     Only nonzero elements need be loaded, and the indexing
C of PA, PB, and PC is the same as in the ADDA routine.
C     Note that if A is independent of Y (or this dependence
C is weak enough to be ignored) then JAC is to compute dg/dy.
C     If it is not feasible to provide a JAC routine, use
C MF = 22, and DLSOIBT will compute an approximate Jacobian
C internally by difference quotients.
C
C E. Next decide whether or not to provide the initial value of the
C derivative vector dy/dt.  If the initial value of A(t,y) is
C nonsingular (and not too ill-conditioned), you may let DLSOIBT compute
C this vector (ISTATE = 0).  (DLSOIBT will solve the system A*s = g for
C s, with initial values of A and g.)  If A(t,y) is initially
C singular, then the system is a differential-algebraic system, and
C you must make use of the particular form of the system to compute the
C initial values of y and dy/dt.  In that case, use ISTATE = 1 and
C load the initial value of dy/dt into the array YDOTI.
C The input array YDOTI and the initial Y array must be consistent with
C the equations A*dy/dt = g.  This implies that the initial residual
C r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*YDOTI  must be approximately zero.
C
C F. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSOIBT once for
C each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
C for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages by
C DLSOIBT.  on the first call to DLSOIBT, supply arguments as follows:
C RES    = name of user subroutine for residual function r.
C ADDA   = name of user subroutine for computing and adding A(t,y).
C JAC    = name of user subroutine for Jacobian matrix dr/dy
C          (MF = 21).  If not used, pass a dummy name.
C Note: the names for the RES and ADDA routines and (if used) the
C        JAC routine must be declared External in the calling program.
C NEQ    = number of scalar equations in the system.
C Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
C YDOTI  = array of length NEQ (containing initial dy/dt if ISTATE = 1).
C T      = the initial value of the independent variable.
C TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
C ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
C RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
C ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
C          the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
C          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
C          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
C          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
C          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
C          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
C          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
C          control.  Caution: Actual (global) errors may exceed these
C          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
C ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
C ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1 if the
C          initial dy/dt is supplied, and 0 otherwise.
C IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
C RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
C             22 + 9*NEQ + 3*MB*MB*NB        for MF = 21 or 22.
C LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
C IWORK  = integer work array of length at least 20 + NEQ.
C          Input in IWORK(1) the block size MB and in IWORK(2) the
C          number NB of blocks in each direction along the matrix A.
C          These must satisfy  MB .ge. 1, NB .ge. 4, and MB*NB = NEQ.
C LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension).
C MF     = method flag.  Standard values are:
C          21 for a user-supplied Jacobian.
C          22 for an internally generated Jacobian.
C          For other choices of MF, see the paragraph on MF in
C          the full description below.
C Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, YDOTI, RWORK, IWORK,
C and possibly ATOL.
C
C G. The output from the first call (or any call) is:
C      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
C      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
C ISTATE = 2  if DLSOIBT was successful, negative otherwise.
C          -1 means excess work done on this call (check all inputs).
C          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
C          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
C          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
C          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian
C             supplied or wrong choice of tolerances).
C          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
C             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
C          -7 cannot occur in casual use.
C          -8 means DLSOIBT was unable to compute the initial dy/dt.
C             In casual use, this means A(t,y) is initially singular.
C             Supply YDOTI and use ISTATE = 1 on the first call.
C
C  If DLSOIBT returns ISTATE = -1, -4, or -5, then the output of
C  DLSOIBT also includes YDOTI = array containing residual vector
C  r = g - A * dy/dt  evaluated at the current t, y, and dy/dt.
C
C H. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
C reset TOUT and call DLSOIBT again.  No other parameters need be reset.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Example Problem.
C
C The following is an example problem, with the coding needed
C for its solution by DLSOIBT.  The problem comes from the partial
C differential equation (the Burgers equation)
C   du/dt  =  - u * du/dx  +  eta * d**2 u/dx**2,   eta = .05,
C on -1 .le. x .le. 1.  The boundary conditions are
C   du/dx = 0  at x = -1 and at x = 1.
C The initial profile is a square wave,
C   u = 1 in ABS(x) .lt. .5,  u = .5 at ABS(x) = .5,  u = 0 elsewhere.
C The PDE is discretized in x by a simplified Galerkin method,
C using piecewise linear basis functions, on a grid of 40 intervals.
C The equations at x = -1 and 1 use a 3-point difference approximation
C for the right-hand side.  The result is a system A * dy/dt = g(y),
C of size NEQ = 41, where y(i) is the approximation to u at x = x(i),
C with x(i) = -1 + (i-1)*delx, delx = 2/(NEQ-1) = .05.  The individual
C equations in the system are
C   dy(1)/dt = ( y(3) - 2*y(2) + y(1) ) * eta / delx**2,
C   dy(NEQ)/dt = ( y(NEQ-2) - 2*y(NEQ-1) + y(NEQ) ) * eta / delx**2,
C and for i = 2, 3, ..., NEQ-1,
C   (1/6) dy(i-1)/dt + (4/6) dy(i)/dt + (1/6) dy(i+1)/dt
C       = ( y(i-1)**2 - y(i+1)**2 ) / (4*delx)
C         + ( y(i+1) - 2*y(i) + y(i-1) ) * eta / delx**2.
C The following coding solves the problem with MF = 21, with output
C of solution statistics at t = .1, .2, .3, and .4, and of the
C solution vector at t = .4.  Here the block size is just MB = 1.

C Full Description of User Interface to DLSOIBT.
C
C The user interface to DLSOIBT consists of the following parts.
C
C 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSOIBT, which is a driver
C      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
C      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
C      Following these descriptions is a description of
C      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
C      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
C
C 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSOIBT package that may be
C      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
C      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
C      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
C
C 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
C      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
C      of the problem and continued solution later.
C
C 4.   Description of two routines in the DLSOIBT package, either of
C      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
C      These relate to the measurement of errors.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 1.  Call Sequence.
C
C The call sequence parameters used for input only are
C     RES, ADDA, JAC, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK,
C     IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
C and those used for both input and output are
C     Y, T, ISTATE, YDOTI.
C The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for additional and
C optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
C to the return from Subroutine DLSOIBT to the user's calling program.)
C
C The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
C initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
C change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
C
C The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
C
C RES    = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which supplies
C          the residual vector for the ODE system, defined by
C            r = g(t,y) - A(t,y) * s
C          as a function of the scalar t and the vectors
C          s and y (s approximates dy/dt).  This subroutine
C          is to have the form
C              SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, S, R, IRES)
C              DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), R(*)
C          where NEQ, T, Y, S, and IRES are input, and R and
C          IRES are output. Y, S, and R are arrays of length NEQ.
C             On input, IRES indicates how DLSOIBT will use the
C          returned array R, as follows:
C             IRES = 1  means that DLSOIBT needs the full residual,
C                       r = g - A*s, exactly.
C             IRES = -1 means that DLSOIBT is using R only to compute
C                       the Jacobian dr/dy by difference quotients.
C          The RES routine can ignore IRES, or it can omit some terms
C          if IRES = -1.  If A does not depend on y, then RES can
C          just return R = g when IRES = -1.  If g - A*s contains other
C          additive terms that are independent of y, these can also be
C          dropped, if done consistently, when IRES = -1.
C             The subroutine should set the flag IRES if it
C          encounters a halt condition or illegal input.
C          Otherwise, it should not reset IRES.  On output,
C             IRES = 1 or -1 represents a normal return, and
C          DLSOIBT continues integrating the ODE.  Leave IRES
C          unchanged from its input value.
C             IRES = 2 tells DLSOIBT to immediately return control
C          to the calling program, with ISTATE = 3.  This lets
C          the calling program change parameters of the problem
C          if necessary.
C             IRES = 3 represents an error condition (for example, an
C          illegal value of y).  DLSOIBT tries to integrate the system
C          without getting IRES = 3 from RES.  If it cannot, DLSOIBT
C          returns with ISTATE = -7 or -1.
C             On an DLSOIBT return with ISTATE = 3, -1, or -7, the
C          values of T and Y returned correspond to the last point
C          reached successfully without getting the flag IRES = 2 or 3.
C             The flag values IRES = 2 and 3 should not be used to
C          handle switches or root-stop conditions.  This is better
C          done by calling DLSOIBT in a one-step mode and checking the
C          stopping function for a sign change at each step.
C             If quantities computed in the RES routine are needed
C          externally to DLSOIBT, an extra call to RES should be made
C          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
C          To get the current dy/dt for the S argument, use DINTDY.
C             RES must be declared External in the calling
C          program. See note below for more about RES.
C
C ADDA   = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which adds the
C          matrix A = A(t,y) to another matrix, P, stored in
C          block-tridiagonal form.  This routine is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE ADDA (NEQ, T, Y, MB, NB, PA, PB, PC)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), PA(MB,MB,NB), PB(MB,MB,NB),
C              1                 PC(MB,MB,NB)
C          where NEQ, T, Y, MB, NB, and the arrays PA, PB, and PC
C          are input, and the arrays PA, PB, and PC are output.
C          Y is an array of length NEQ, and the arrays PA, PB, PC
C          are all MB by MB by NB.
C             Here a block-tridiagonal structure is assumed for A(t,y),
C          and also for the matrix P to which A is added here,
C          as described in Paragraph B of the Summary of Usage above.
C          Thus the affect of ADDA should be the following:
C               DO 30 K = 1,NB
C                 DO 20 J = 1,MB
C                   DO 10 I = 1,MB
C                     PA(I,J,K) = PA(I,J,K) +
C                       ( (I,J) element of K-th diagonal block of A)
C                     PB(I,J,K) = PB(I,J,K) +
C                       ( (I,J) element of block (K,K+1) of A,
C                       or block (NB,NB-2) if K = NB)
C                     PC(I,J,K) = PC(I,J,K) +
C                       ( (I,J) element of block (K,K-1) of A,
C                       or block (1,3) if K = 1)
C           10        CONTINUE
C           20      CONTINUE
C           30    CONTINUE
C             ADDA must be declared External in the calling program.
C          See note below for more information about ADDA.
C
C JAC    = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which supplies
C          the Jacobian matrix, dr/dy, where r = g - A*s.  JAC is
C          required if MITER = 1.  Otherwise a dummy name can be
C          passed.  This subroutine is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, S, MB, NB, PA, PB, PC)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), PA(MB,MB,NB),
C              1                 PB(MB,MB,NB), PC(MB,MB,NB)
C          where NEQ, T, Y, S, MB, NB, and the arrays PA, PB, and PC
C          are input, and the arrays PA, PB, and PC are output.
C          Y and S are arrays of length NEQ, and the arrays PA, PB, PC
C          are all MB by MB by NB.
C          PA, PB, and PC are to be loaded with partial derivatives
C          (elements of the Jacobian matrix) on output, in terms of the
C          block-tridiagonal structure assumed, as described
C          in Paragraph B of the Summary of Usage above.
C          That is, load the diagonal blocks into PA, the
C          superdiagonal blocks (and block (NB,NB-2) ) into PB, and
C          the subdiagonal blocks (and block (1,3) ) into PC.
C          The blocks in block-row k of dr/dy are to be loaded into
C          PA(*,*,k), PB(*,*,k), and PC(*,*,k).
C          Thus the affect of JAC should be the following:
C               DO 30 K = 1,NB
C                 DO 20 J = 1,MB
C                   DO 10 I = 1,MB
C                     PA(I,J,K) = ( (I,J) element of
C                       K-th diagonal block of dr/dy)
C                     PB(I,J,K) = ( (I,J) element of block (K,K+1)
C                       of dr/dy, or block (NB,NB-2) if K = NB)
C                     PC(I,J,K) = ( (I,J) element of block (K,K-1)
C                       of dr/dy, or block (1,3) if K = 1)
C           10        CONTINUE
C           20      CONTINUE
C           30    CONTINUE
C               PA, PB, and PC are preset to zero by the solver,
C          so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
C          Each call to JAC is preceded by a call to RES with the same
C          arguments NEQ, T, Y, and S.  Thus to gain some efficiency,
C          intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be
C          saved in a user Common block by RES and not recomputed by JAC
C          if desired.  Also, JAC may alter the Y array, if desired.
C               JAC need not provide dr/dy exactly.  A crude
C          approximation will do, so that DLSOIBT may be used when
C          A and dr/dy are not really block-tridiagonal, but are close
C          to matrices that are.
C               JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
C               See note below for more about JAC.
C
C    Note on RES, ADDA, and JAC:
C          These subroutines may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in the subroutines) and/or Y has length
C          exceeding NEQ(1).  However, these routines should not alter
C          NEQ(1), Y(1),...,Y(NEQ) or any other input variables.
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
C
C NEQ    = the size of the system (number of first order ordinary
C          differential equations or scalar algebraic equations).
C          Used only for input.
C          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
C          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
C          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
C          these are to be accessed in RES, ADDA, or JAC.
C
C          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
C          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
C          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
C          (The DLSOIBT package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
C          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
C          to RES, ADDA, and JAC.  Hence, if it is an array,
C          locations NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data
C          and pass it to RES, ADDA, or JAC.  Each such subroutine
C          must include NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
C
C Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
C          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
C          first call (ISTATE = 0 or 1), and only for output on other
C          calls.  On the first call, Y must contain the vector of
C          initial values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution
C          vector, evaluated at t.  If desired, the Y array may be used
C          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
C
C          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to RES,
C          ADDA, and JAC.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ,
C          and locations Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real
C          data and pass it to RES, ADDA, or JAC.  (The DLSOIBT
C          package accesses only Y(1),...,Y(NEQ). )
C
C YDOTI  = a real array for the initial value of the vector
C          dy/dt and for work space, of dimension at least NEQ.
C
C          On input:
C            If ISTATE = 0 then DLSOIBT will compute the initial value
C          of dy/dt, if A is nonsingular.  Thus YDOTI will
C          serve only as work space and may have any value.
C            If ISTATE = 1 then YDOTI must contain the initial value
C          of dy/dt.
C            If ISTATE = 2 or 3 (continuation calls) then YDOTI
C          may have any value.
C            Note: If the initial value of A is singular, then
C          DLSOIBT cannot compute the initial value of dy/dt, so
C          it must be provided in YDOTI, with ISTATE = 1.
C
C          On output, when DLSOIBT terminates abnormally with ISTATE =
C          -1, -4, or -5, YDOTI will contain the residual
C          r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*(dy/dt).  If r is large, t is near
C          its initial value, and YDOTI is supplied with ISTATE = 1,
C          there may have been an incorrect input value of
C          YDOTI = dy/dt, or the problem (as given to DLSOIBT)
C          may not have a solution.
C
C          If desired, the YDOTI array may be used for other
C          purposes between calls to the solver.
C
C T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
C          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
C          On output, after each call, T is the value at which a
C          computed solution y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
C          On an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
C
C TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
C          Used only for input.
C
C          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 0 or 1), TOUT may be
C          equal to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next
C          call.  For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is
C          used in order to determine the direction of the integration
C          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
C          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
C          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
C
C          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
C          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
C          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
C
C          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
C          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
C          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
C          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
C          TCUR and HU).
C
C ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
C          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
C
C RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
C          Input only.
C
C ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
C
C             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
C          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
C          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
C          in y, according to an inequality of the form
C                      RMS-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
C          where       EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
C          and the RMS-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
C          RMS-norm(v) = SQRT(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).  Here EWT = (EWT(i))
C          is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
C          the values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
C          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
C          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
C
C             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
C              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              4     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C
C          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
C          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
C
C          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
C          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
C          error controls can be obtained by substituting
C          user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
C          the norm calculation.  See Part 4 below.
C
C          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
C          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
C          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
C          down uniformly.
C
C ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
C          Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
C          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
C          2  means take one step only and return.
C          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
C             beyond t = TOUT and return.
C          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
C             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
C             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
C             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
C          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
C
C          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
C          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
C          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
C          in which case answers at t = TOUT are returned first).
C
C ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
C          state of the calculation.
C
C          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
C          0  means this is the first call for the problem, and
C             DLSOIBT is to compute the initial value of dy/dt
C             (while doing other initializations).  See note below.
C          1  means this is the first call for the problem, and
C             the initial value of dy/dt has been supplied in
C             YDOTI (DLSOIBT will do other initializations).
C             See note below.
C          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
C             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
C             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
C             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
C             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
C             tested for legality.)
C          3  means this is not the first call, and the
C             calculation is to continue normally, but with
C             a change in input parameters other than
C             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
C             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF, MB, NB,
C             and any of the optional inputs except H0.
C             (See IWORK description for MB and NB.)
C          Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
C          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
C          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
C          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
C          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
C          ISTATE = 0 or 1 on input.
C
C          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
C           0 or 1  means nothing was done; TOUT = t and
C              ISTATE = 0 or 1 on input.
C           2  means that the integration was performed successfully.
C           3  means that the user-supplied Subroutine RES signalled
C              DLSOIBT to halt the integration and return (IRES = 2).
C              Integration as far as T was achieved with no occurrence
C              of IRES = 2, but this flag was set on attempting the
C              next step.
C          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
C              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
C              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
C              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
C              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
C              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
C              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
C              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
C              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
C          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
C              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
C              completing the requested task, but the integration
C              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
C              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
C              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
C              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
C              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
C              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
C          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
C              integration steps.  See written message for details.
C              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
C              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
C              the run to stop.
C          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
C              may be inappropriate.
C          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix.
C          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
C              integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i) = 0.0)
C              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
C              The integration was successful as far as T.
C          -7  means that the user-supplied Subroutine RES set
C              its error flag (IRES = 3) despite repeated tries by
C              DLSOIBT to avoid that condition.
C          -8  means that ISTATE was 0 on input but DLSOIBT was unable
C              to compute the initial value of dy/dt.  See the
C              printed message for details.
C
C          Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
C          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
C          Similarly, ISTATE (= 3) need not be reset if RES told
C          DLSOIBT to return because the calling program must change
C          the parameters of the problem.
C          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
C          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
C          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
C          calling the solver again.
C
C IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
C          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
C          The optional inputs are listed separately below.
C          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
C                   Default values will be used in all cases.
C          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
C
C RWORK  = a real working array (double precision).
C          The length of RWORK must be at least
C             20 + NYH*(MAXORD + 1) + 3*NEQ + LENWM    where
C          NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
C          MAXORD = 12 (if METH = 1) or 5 (if METH = 2) (unless a
C                   smaller value is given as an optional input),
C          LENWM  = 3*MB*MB*NB + 2.
C          (See MF description for the definition of METH.)
C          Thus if MAXORD has its default value and NEQ is constant,
C          this length is
C             22 + 16*NEQ + 3*MB*MB*NB     for MF = 11 or 12,
C             22 + 9*NEQ + 3*MB*MB*NB      for MF = 21 or 22.
C          The first 20 words of RWORK are reserved for conditional
C          and optional inputs and optional outputs.
C
C          The following word in RWORK is a conditional input:
C            RWORK(1) = TCRIT = critical value of t which the solver
C                       is not to overshoot.  Required if ITASK is
C                       4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  (See ITASK.)
C
C LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C IWORK  = an integer work array.  The length of IWORK must be at least
C          20 + NEQ .  The first few words of IWORK are used for
C          additional and optional inputs and optional outputs.
C
C          The following 2 words in IWORK are additional required
C          inputs to DLSOIBT:
C            IWORK(1) = MB = block size
C            IWORK(2) = NB = number of blocks in the main diagonal
C          These must satisfy  MB .ge. 1, NB .ge. 4, and MB*NB = NEQ.
C
C LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C Note:  The work arrays must not be altered between calls to DLSOIBT
C for the same problem, except possibly for the additional and
C optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
C The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
C available for use by the user outside DLSOIBT between calls, if
C desired (but not for use by RES, ADDA, or JAC).
C
C MF     = the method flag.  used only for input.  The legal values of
C          MF are 11, 12, 21, and 22.
C          MF has decimal digits METH and MITER: MF = 10*METH + MITER.
C            METH indicates the basic linear multistep method:
C              METH = 1 means the implicit Adams method.
C              METH = 2 means the method based on Backward
C                       Differentiation Formulas (BDFS).
C                The BDF method is strongly preferred for stiff
C              problems, while the Adams method is preferred when the
C              problem is not stiff.  If the matrix A(t,y) is
C              nonsingular, stiffness here can be taken to mean that of
C              the explicit ODE system dy/dt = A-inverse * g.  If A is
C              singular, the concept of stiffness is not well defined.
C                If you do not know whether the problem is stiff, we
C              recommend using METH = 2.  If it is stiff, the advantage
C              of METH = 2 over METH = 1 will be great, while if it is
C              not stiff, the advantage of METH = 1 will be slight.
C              If maximum efficiency is important, some experimentation
C              with METH may be necessary.
C            MITER indicates the corrector iteration method:
C              MITER = 1 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
C                        block-tridiagonal Jacobian.
C              MITER = 2 means chord iteration with an internally
C                        generated (difference quotient) block-
C                        tridiagonal Jacobian approximation, using
C                        3*MB+1 extra calls to RES per dr/dy evaluation.
C              If MITER = 1, the user must supply a Subroutine JAC
C              (the name is arbitrary) as described above under JAC.
C              For MITER = 2, a dummy argument can be used.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Inputs.
C
C The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
C call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
C this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
C location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
C The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
C case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
C of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
C Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
C locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
C then set those of interest to nonzero values.
C
C Name    Location      Meaning and Default Value
C
C H0      RWORK(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
C                   The default value is determined by the solver.
C
C HMAX    RWORK(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is infinite.
C
C HMIN    RWORK(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
C                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
C                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
C
C MAXORD  IWORK(5)  the maximum order to be allowed.  The default
C                   value is 12 if METH = 1, and 5 if METH = 2.
C                   If MAXORD exceeds the default value, it will
C                   be reduced to the default value.
C                   If MAXORD is changed during the problem, it may
C                   cause the current order to be reduced.
C
C MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
C                   allowed during one call to the solver.
C                   The default value is 500.
C
C MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
C                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
C                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
C                   value.  The default value is 10.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Outputs.
C
C As optional additional output from DLSOIBT, the variables listed
C below are quantities related to the performance of DLSOIBT
C which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
C the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
C Except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
C on any successful return from DLSOIBT, and on any return with
C ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, -6, or -7.  On a return with -3 (illegal
C input) or -8, they will be unchanged from their existing values
C (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
C On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
C as noted below.
C
C Name    Location      Meaning
C
C HU      RWORK(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
C
C HCUR    RWORK(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
C
C TCUR    RWORK(13) the current value of the independent variable
C                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
C                   current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
C                   will always be at least as far as the argument
C                   T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
C
C TOLSF   RWORK(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
C                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
C                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
C                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
C                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
C                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
C                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
C                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
C                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
C
C NST     IWORK(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
C
C NRE     IWORK(12) the number of residual evaluations (RES calls)
C                   for the problem so far.
C
C NJE     IWORK(13) the number of Jacobian evaluations (each involving
C                   an evaluation of a and dr/dy) for the problem so
C                   far.  This equals the number of calls to ADDA and
C                   (if MITER = 1) to JAC, and the number of matrix
C                   LU decompositions.
C
C NQU     IWORK(14) the method order last used (successfully).
C
C NQCUR   IWORK(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.
C
C IMXER   IWORK(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
C                   the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
C                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
C
C LENRW   IWORK(17) the length of RWORK actually required.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C LENIW   IWORK(18) the length of IWORK actually required.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C
C The following two arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
C may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
C For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
C its base address in RWORK, and its description.
C
C Name    Base Address      Description
C
C YH      21             the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
C                        (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
C                        of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
C                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
C                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
C                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
C                        evaluated at t = TCUR.
C
C ACOR     LENRW-NEQ+1   array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
C                        corrections on each step, scaled on output to
C                        represent the estimated local error in y on
C                        the last step.  This is the vector E in the
C                        description of the error control.  It is
C                        defined only on a return from DLSOIBT with
C                        ISTATE = 2.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.
C
C The following are optional calls which the user may make to
C gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSOIBT.
C (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
C SLATEC error handling package.)
C
C     Form of Call                  Function
C   CALL XSETUN(LUN)          Set the logical unit number, LUN, for
C                             output of messages from DLSOIBT, if
C                             the default is not desired.
C                             The default value of LUN is 6.
C
C   CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         Set a flag to control the printing of
C                             messages by DLSOIBT.
C                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger:
C                             This risks losing valuable information.)
C                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).
C
C                             Either of the above calls may be made at
C                             any time and will take effect immediately.
C
C   CALL DSRCOM(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) saves and restores the contents of
C                             the internal Common blocks used by
C                             DLSOIBT (see Part 3 below).
C                             RSAV must be a real array of length 218
C                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
C                             array of length 37 or more.
C                             JOB=1 means save Common into RSAV/ISAV.
C                             JOB=2 means restore Common from RSAV/ISAV.
C                                DSRCOM is useful if one is
C                             interrupting a run and restarting
C                             later, or alternating between two or
C                             more problems solved with DLSOIBT.
C
C   CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        Provide derivatives of y, of various
C        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
C                             desired.  It may be called only after
C                             a successful return from DLSOIBT.
C
C The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.
C The form of the call is:
C
C   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(21), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
C
C The input parameters are:
C
C T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
C             (normally the same as the t last returned by DLSOIBT).
C             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
C             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
C K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
C             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
C             (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
C             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(t), is already provided
C             by DLSOIBT directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
C             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
C RWORK(21) = the base address of the history array YH.
C NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
C
C The output parameters are:
C
C DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
C             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
C IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
C             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
C             On an error return, a message is also written.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 3.  Common Blocks.
C
C If DLSOIBT is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
C must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
C   (1) the call sequence to DLSOIBT, and
C   (2) the internal Common block
C         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
C                      followed by 37 integer words),
C
C If DLSOIBT is used on a system in which the contents of internal
C Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
C declare the above Common block in the calling program to insure
C that their contents are preserved.
C
C If the solution of a given problem by DLSOIBT is to be interrupted
C and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
C or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
C following the return from the last DLSOIBT call prior to the
C interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
C internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
C next DLSOIBT call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
C blocks, use Subroutine DSRCOM (see Part 2 above).
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
C
C Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSOIBT package which
C relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
C replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
C a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
C done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
C (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
C superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
C
C (a) DEWSET.
C The following subroutine is called just before each internal
C integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
C described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
C     SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
C where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSOIBT call sequence,
C YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
C EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
C
C If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
C (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
C in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the DVNORM
C routine (see below), and also used by DLSOIBT in the computation
C of the optional output IMXER, the diagonal Jacobian approximation,
C and the increments for difference quotient Jacobians.
C
C In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
C the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
C are available from the history array YH, described above under
C optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
C extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
C factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
C given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
C NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
C can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
C     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
C     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
C     NQ = ILS(33)
C     NST = ILS(34)
C     H = RLS(212)
C Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
C YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
C unnecessary when NST = 0).
C
C (b) DVNORM.
C The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
C root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
C     D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
C where:
C   N = the length of the vector,
C   V = real array of length N containing the vector,
C   W = real array of length N containing weights,
C   D = SQRT( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
C DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
C EWT is as set by Subroutine DEWSET.
C
C If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
C value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSOIBT.
C None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
C For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
C   -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*W(i)) for the RMS-norm, or
C   -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
C    suppressing the error control on those components of y.

C This is the 18 November 2003 version of
C DLSODIS: Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential equations
C          (Implicit form) with general Sparse Jacobian matrices.
C
C This version is in double precision.
C
C DLSODIS solves the initial value problem for linearly implicit
C systems of first order ODEs,
C     A(t,y) * dy/dt = g(t,y) ,  where A(t,y) is a square matrix,
C or, in component form,
C     ( a   * ( dy / dt ))  + ... +  ( a     * ( dy   / dt ))  =
C        i,1      1                     i,NEQ      NEQ
C
C      =   g ( t, y , y ,..., y    )   ( i = 1,...,NEQ )
C           i      1   2       NEQ
C
C If A is singular, this is a differential-algebraic system.
C
C DLSODIS is a variant version of the DLSODI package, and is intended
C for stiff problems in which the matrix A and the Jacobian matrix
C d(g - A*s)/dy have arbitrary sparse structures.

C Summary of Usage.
C
C Communication between the user and the DLSODIS package, for normal
C situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
C of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
C details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
C and instructions for special situations.  See also the example
C problem (with program and output) following this summary.
C
C A. First, provide a subroutine of the form:
C                SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, S, R, IRES)
C                DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), R(*)
C which computes the residual function
C      r = g(t,y)  -  A(t,y) * s ,
C as a function of t and the vectors y and s.  (s is an internally
C generated approximation to dy/dt.)  The arrays Y and S are inputs
C to the RES routine and should not be altered.  The residual
C vector is to be stored in the array R.  The argument IRES should be
C ignored for casual use of DLSODIS.  (For uses of IRES, see the
C paragraph on RES in the full description below.)
C
C B. DLSODIS must deal internally with the matrices A and dr/dy, where
C r is the residual function defined above.  DLSODIS generates a linear
C combination of these two matrices in sparse form.
C      The matrix structure is communicated by a method flag, MF:
C         MF =  21 or  22     when the user provides the structures of
C                             matrix A and dr/dy,
C         MF = 121 or 222     when the user does not provide structure
C                             information, and
C         MF = 321 or 422     when the user provides the structure
C                             of matrix A.
C
C C. You must also provide a subroutine of the form:
C                SUBROUTINE ADDA (NEQ, T, Y, J, IAN, JAN, P)
C                DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), P(*)
C                INTEGER IAN(*), JAN(*)
C which adds the matrix A = A(t,y) to the contents of the array P.
C NEQ, T, Y, and J are input arguments and should not be altered.
C This routine should add the J-th column of matrix A to the array
C P (of length NEQ).  I.e. add A(i,J) to P(i) for all relevant
C values of i.  The arguments IAN and JAN should be ignored for normal
C situations.  DLSODIS will call the ADDA routine with J = 1,2,...,NEQ.
C
C D. For the sake of efficiency, you are encouraged to supply the
C Jacobian matrix dr/dy in closed form, where r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*s
C (s = a fixed vector) as above.  If dr/dy is being supplied,
C use MF = 21, 121, or 321, and provide a subroutine of the form:
C               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, S, J, IAN, JAN, PDJ)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), PDJ(*)
C               INTEGER IAN(*), JAN(*)
C which computes dr/dy as a function of t, y, and s.  Here NEQ, T, Y, S,
C and J are input arguments, and the JAC routine is to load the array
C PDJ (of length NEQ) with the J-th column of dr/dy.  I.e. load PDJ(i)
C with dr(i)/dy(J) for all relevant values of i.  The arguments IAN and
C JAN should be ignored for normal situations.  DLSODIS will call the
C JAC routine with J = 1,2,...,NEQ.
C      Only nonzero elements need be loaded.  A crude approximation
C to dr/dy, possibly with fewer nonzero elememts, will suffice.
C Note that if A is independent of y (or this dependence
C is weak enough to be ignored) then JAC is to compute dg/dy.
C      If it is not feasible to provide a JAC routine, use
C MF = 22, 222, or 422 and DLSODIS will compute an approximate
C Jacobian internally by difference quotients.
C
C E. Next decide whether or not to provide the initial value of the
C derivative vector dy/dt.  If the initial value of A(t,y) is
C nonsingular (and not too ill-conditioned), you may let DLSODIS compute
C this vector (ISTATE = 0).  (DLSODIS will solve the system A*s = g for
C s, with initial values of A and g.)  If A(t,y) is initially
C singular, then the system is a differential-algebraic system, and
C you must make use of the particular form of the system to compute the
C initial values of y and dy/dt.  In that case, use ISTATE = 1 and
C load the initial value of dy/dt into the array YDOTI.
C The input array YDOTI and the initial Y array must be consistent with
C the equations A*dy/dt = g.  This implies that the initial residual
C r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*YDOTI   must be approximately zero.
C
C F. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODIS once for
C each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
C for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages by
C DLSODIS.  On the first call to DLSODIS, supply arguments as follows:
C RES    = name of user subroutine for residual function r.
C ADDA   = name of user subroutine for computing and adding A(t,y).
C JAC    = name of user subroutine for Jacobian matrix dr/dy
C          (MF = 121).  If not used, pass a dummy name.
C Note: The names for the RES and ADDA routines and (if used) the
C        JAC routine must be declared External in the calling program.
C NEQ    = number of scalar equations in the system.
C Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
C YDOTI  = array of length NEQ (containing initial dy/dt if ISTATE = 1).
C T      = the initial value of the independent variable.
C TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
C ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
C RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
C ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
C          The estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
C          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
C          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
C          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
C          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
C          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
C          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
C          control.  Caution: Actual (global) errors may exceed these
C          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
C ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
C ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1 if the
C          initial dy/dt is supplied, and 0 otherwise.
C IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
C RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
C             20 + (2 + 1./LENRAT)*NNZ + (11 + 9./LENRAT)*NEQ
C          where:
C          NNZ    = the number of nonzero elements in the sparse
C                   iteration matrix  P = A - con*dr/dy (con = scalar)
C                   (If NNZ is unknown, use an estimate of it.)
C          LENRAT = the real to integer wordlength ratio (usually 1 in
C                   single precision and 2 in double precision).
C          In any case, the required size of RWORK cannot generally
C          be predicted in advance for any value of MF, and the
C          value above is a rough estimate of a crude lower bound.
C          Some experimentation with this size may be necessary.
C          (When known, the correct required length is an optional
C          output, available in IWORK(17).)
C LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
C IWORK  = integer work array of length at least 30.
C LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension).
C MF     = method flag.  Standard values are:
C          121 for a user-supplied sparse Jacobian.
C          222 for an internally generated sparse Jacobian.
C          For other choices of MF, see the paragraph on MF in
C          the full description below.
C Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, YDOTI, RWORK, IWORK,
C and possibly ATOL.
C
C G. The output from the first call, or any call, is:
C      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
C      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
C ISTATE =  2  if DLSODIS was successful, negative otherwise.
C          -1 means excess work done on this call (check all inputs).
C          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
C          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
C          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
C          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian
C             supplied or wrong choice of tolerances).
C          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
C             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
C          -7 cannot occur in casual use.
C          -8 means DLSODIS was unable to compute the initial dy/dt.
C             in casual use, this means A(t,y) is initially singular.
C             Supply YDOTI and use ISTATE = 1 on the first call.
C          -9 means a fatal error return flag came from sparse solver
C             CDRV by way of DPRJIS or DSOLSS.  Should never happen.
C
C          A return with ISTATE = -1, -4, or -5, may result from using
C          an inappropriate sparsity structure, one that is quite
C          different from the initial structure.  Consider calling
C          DLSODIS again with ISTATE = 3 to force the structure to be
C          reevaluated.  See the full description of ISTATE below.
C
C  If DLSODIS returns ISTATE = -1, -4  or -5, then the output of
C  DLSODIS also includes YDOTI = array containing residual vector
C  r = g - A * dy/dt  evaluated at the current t, y, and dy/dt.
C
C H. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
C reset TOUT and call DLSODIS again.  No other parameters need be reset.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Example Problem.
C
C The following is an example problem, with the coding needed
C for its solution by DLSODIS.  The problem comes from the partial
C differential equation (the Burgers equation)
C   du/dt  =  - u * du/dx  +  eta * d**2 u/dx**2,   eta = .05,
C on -1 .le. x .le. 1.  The boundary conditions are periodic:
C   u(-1,t) = u(1,t)  and  du/dx(-1,t) = du/dx(1,t)
C The initial profile is a square wave,
C   u = 1 in ABS(x) .lt. .5,  u = .5 at ABS(x) = .5,  u = 0 elsewhere.
C The PDE is discretized in x by a simplified Galerkin method,
C using piecewise linear basis functions, on a grid of 40 intervals.
C The result is a system A * dy/dt = g(y), of size NEQ = 40,
C where y(i) is the approximation to u at x = x(i), with
C x(i) = -1 + (i-1)*delx, delx = 2/NEQ = .05.
C The individual equations in the system are (in order):
C  (1/6)dy(NEQ)/dt+(4/6)dy(1)/dt+(1/6)dy(2)/dt
C       = r4d*(y(NEQ)**2-y(2)**2)+eodsq*(y(2)-2*y(1)+y(NEQ))
C for i = 2,3,...,nm1,
C  (1/6)dy(i-1)/dt+(4/6)dy(i)/dt+(1/6)dy(i+1)/dt
C       = r4d*(y(i-1)**2-y(i+1)**2)+eodsq*(y(i+1)-2*y(i)+y(i-1))
C and finally
C  (1/6)dy(nm1)/dt+(4/6)dy(NEQ)/dt+(1/6)dy(1)/dt
C       = r4d*(y(nm1)**2-y(1)**2)+eodsq*(y(1)-2*y(NEQ)+y(nm1))
C where r4d = 1/(4*delx), eodsq = eta/delx**2 and nm1 = NEQ-1.
C The following coding solves the problem with MF = 121, with output
C of solution statistics at t = .1, .2, .3, and .4, and of the
C solution vector at t = .4.  Optional outputs (run statistics) are
C also printed.

C Full Description of User Interface to DLSODIS.
C
C The user interface to DLSODIS consists of the following parts.
C
C 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODIS, which is a driver
C      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
C      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
C      Following these descriptions is a description of
C      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
C      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
C
C 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODIS package that may be
C      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
C      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
C      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
C
C 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
C      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
C      of the problem and continued solution later.
C
C 4.   Description of two routines in the DLSODIS package, either of
C      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
C      These relate to the measurement of errors.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 1.  Call Sequence.
C
C The call sequence parameters used for input only are
C     RES, ADDA, JAC, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK,
C     IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
C and those used for both input and output are
C     Y, T, ISTATE, YDOTI.
C The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
C optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
C to the return from Subroutine DLSODIS to the user's calling program.)
C
C The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
C initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
C change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
C
C The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
C
C RES    = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which supplies
C          the residual vector for the ODE system, defined by
C            r = g(t,y) - A(t,y) * s
C          as a function of the scalar t and the vectors
C          s and y (s approximates dy/dt).  This subroutine
C          is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, S, R, IRES)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), R(*)
C          where NEQ, T, Y, S, and IRES are input, and R and
C          IRES are output.  Y, S, and R are arrays of length NEQ.
C             On input, IRES indicates how DLSODIS will use the
C          returned array R, as follows:
C             IRES = 1  means that DLSODIS needs the full residual,
C                       r = g - A*s, exactly.
C             IRES = -1 means that DLSODIS is using R only to compute
C                       the Jacobian dr/dy by difference quotients.
C          The RES routine can ignore IRES, or it can omit some terms
C          if IRES = -1.  If A does not depend on y, then RES can
C          just return R = g when IRES = -1.  If g - A*s contains other
C          additive terms that are independent of y, these can also be
C          dropped, if done consistently, when IRES = -1.
C             The subroutine should set the flag IRES if it
C          encounters a halt condition or illegal input.
C          Otherwise, it should not reset IRES.  On output,
C             IRES = 1 or -1 represents a normal return, and
C          DLSODIS continues integrating the ODE.  Leave IRES
C          unchanged from its input value.
C             IRES = 2 tells DLSODIS to immediately return control
C          to the calling program, with ISTATE = 3.  This lets
C          the calling program change parameters of the problem
C          if necessary.
C             IRES = 3 represents an error condition (for example, an
C          illegal value of y).  DLSODIS tries to integrate the system
C          without getting IRES = 3 from RES.  If it cannot, DLSODIS
C          returns with ISTATE = -7 or -1.
C             On a return with ISTATE = 3, -1, or -7, the values
C          of T and Y returned correspond to the last point reached
C          successfully without getting the flag IRES = 2 or 3.
C             The flag values IRES = 2 and 3 should not be used to
C          handle switches or root-stop conditions.  This is better
C          done by calling DLSODIS in a one-step mode and checking the
C          stopping function for a sign change at each step.
C             If quantities computed in the RES routine are needed
C          externally to DLSODIS, an extra call to RES should be made
C          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
C          To get the current dy/dt for the S argument, use DINTDY.
C             RES must be declared External in the calling
C          program.  See note below for more about RES.
C
C ADDA   = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which adds the
C          matrix A = A(t,y) to another matrix stored in sparse form.
C          This subroutine is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE ADDA (NEQ, T, Y, J, IAN, JAN, P)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), P(*)
C               INTEGER IAN(*), JAN(*)
C          where NEQ, T, Y, J, IAN, JAN, and P  are input.  This routine
C          should add the J-th column of matrix A to the array P, of
C          length NEQ.  Thus a(i,J) is to be added to P(i) for all
C          relevant values of i.  Here T and Y have the same meaning as
C          in Subroutine RES, and J is a column index (1 to NEQ).
C          IAN and JAN are undefined in calls to ADDA for structure
C          determination (MOSS .ne. 0).  Otherwise, IAN and JAN are
C          structure descriptors, as defined under optional outputs
C          below, and so can be used to determine the relevant row
C          indices i, if desired.
C               Calls to ADDA are made with J = 1,...,NEQ, in that
C          order.  ADDA must not alter its input arguments.
C               ADDA must be declared External in the calling program.
C          See note below for more information about ADDA.
C
C JAC    = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which supplies
C          the Jacobian matrix, dr/dy, where r = g - A*s.  JAC is
C          required if MITER = 1, or MOSS = 1 or 3.  Otherwise a dummy
C          name can be passed.  This subroutine is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, S, J, IAN, JAN, PDJ)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), PDJ(*)
C               INTEGER IAN(*), JAN(*)
C         where NEQ, T, Y, S, J, IAN, and JAN are input.  The
C         array PDJ, of length NEQ, is to be loaded with column J
C         of the Jacobian on output.  Thus dr(i)/dy(J) is to be
C         loaded into PDJ(i) for all relevant values of i.
C         Here T, Y, and S have the same meaning as in Subroutine RES,
C         and J is a column index (1 to NEQ).  IAN and JAN
C         are undefined in calls to JAC for structure determination
C         (MOSS .ne. 0).  Otherwise, IAN and JAN are structure
C         descriptors, as defined under optional outputs below, and
C         so can be used to determine the relevant row indices i, if
C         desired.
C              JAC need not provide dr/dy exactly.  A crude
C         approximation (possibly with greater sparsity) will do.
C              In any case, PDJ is preset to zero by the solver,
C         so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
C         Calls to JAC are made with J = 1,...,NEQ, in that order, and
C         each such set of calls is preceded by a call to RES with the
C         same arguments NEQ, T, Y, S, and IRES.  Thus to gain some
C         efficiency intermediate quantities shared by both calculations
C         may be saved in a user Common block by RES and not recomputed
C         by JAC, if desired.  JAC must not alter its input arguments.
C              JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
C              See note below for more about JAC.
C
C    Note on RES, ADDA, and JAC:
C          These subroutines may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in the subroutines) and/or Y has length
C          exceeding NEQ(1).  However, these subroutines should not
C          alter NEQ(1), Y(1),...,Y(NEQ) or any other input variables.
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
C
C NEQ    = the size of the system (number of first order ordinary
C          differential equations or scalar algebraic equations).
C          Used only for input.
C          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
C          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
C          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
C          these are to be accessed in RES, ADDA, or JAC.
C
C          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
C          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
C          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
C          (The DLSODIS package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
C          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
C          to RES, ADDA, and JAC.  Hence, if it is an array,
C          locations NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data
C          and pass it to RES, ADDA, or JAC.  Each such subroutine
C          must include NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
C
C Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
C          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
C          first call (ISTATE = 0 or 1), and only for output on other
C          calls.  On the first call, Y must contain the vector of
C          initial values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution
C          vector, evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
C          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
C
C          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to RES,
C          ADDA, and JAC.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ,
C          and locations Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real
C          data and pass it to RES, ADDA, or JAC.  (The DLSODIS
C          package accesses only Y(1),...,Y(NEQ). )
C
C YDOTI  = a real array for the initial value of the vector
C          dy/dt and for work space, of dimension at least NEQ.
C
C          On input:
C            If ISTATE = 0 then DLSODIS will compute the initial value
C          of dy/dt, if A is nonsingular.  Thus YDOTI will
C          serve only as work space and may have any value.
C            If ISTATE = 1 then YDOTI must contain the initial value
C          of dy/dt.
C            If ISTATE = 2 or 3 (continuation calls) then YDOTI
C          may have any value.
C            Note: If the initial value of A is singular, then
C          DLSODIS cannot compute the initial value of dy/dt, so
C          it must be provided in YDOTI, with ISTATE = 1.
C
C          On output, when DLSODIS terminates abnormally with ISTATE =
C          -1, -4, or -5, YDOTI will contain the residual
C          r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*(dy/dt).  If r is large, t is near
C          its initial value, and YDOTI is supplied with ISTATE = 1,
C          there may have been an incorrect input value of
C          YDOTI = dy/dt, or the problem (as given to DLSODIS)
C          may not have a solution.
C
C          If desired, the YDOTI array may be used for other
C          purposes between calls to the solver.
C
C T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
C          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
C          On output, after each call, T is the value at which a
C          computed solution y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
C          On an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
C
C TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
C          Used only for input.
C
C          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 0 or 1), TOUT may be
C          equal to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next
C          call.  For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is
C          used in order to determine the direction of the integration
C          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
C          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
C          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
C
C          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
C          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
C          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
C
C          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
C          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
C          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
C          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
C          TCUR and HU).
C
C ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
C          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
C
C RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
C          Input only.
C
C ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
C
C             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
C          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
C          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
C          in y, according to an inequality of the form
C                      RMS-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
C          where       EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
C          and the RMS-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
C          RMS-norm(v) = SQRT(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).  Here EWT = (EWT(i))
C          is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
C          the values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
C          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
C          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
C
C             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
C              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              4     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C
C          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
C          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
C
C          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
C          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
C          error controls can be obtained by substituting
C          user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
C          the norm calculation.  See Part 4 below.
C
C          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
C          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
C          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
C          down uniformly.
C
C ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
C          Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
C          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
C          2  means take one step only and return.
C          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
C             beyond t = TOUT and return.
C          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
C             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
C             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
C             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
C          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
C
C          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
C          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
C          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
C          in which case answers at t = TOUT are returned first).
C
C ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
C          state of the calculation.
C
C          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
C          0  means this is the first call for the problem, and
C             DLSODIS is to compute the initial value of dy/dt
C             (while doing other initializations).  See note below.
C          1  means this is the first call for the problem, and
C             the initial value of dy/dt has been supplied in
C             YDOTI (DLSODIS will do other initializations).
C             See note below.
C          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
C             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
C             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
C             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
C             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
C             tested for legality.)
C          3  means this is not the first call, and the
C             calculation is to continue normally, but with
C             a change in input parameters other than
C             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
C             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
C             the conditional inputs IA, JA, IC, and JC,
C             and any of the optional inputs except H0.
C             A call with ISTATE = 3 will cause the sparsity
C             structure of the problem to be recomputed.
C             (Structure information is reread from IA and JA if
C             MOSS = 0, 3, or 4 and from IC and JC if MOSS = 0).
C          Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
C          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
C          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
C          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
C          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
C          ISTATE = 0 or 1 on input.
C
C          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
C           0 or 1  means nothing was done; TOUT = T and
C              ISTATE = 0 or 1 on input.
C           2  means that the integration was performed successfully.
C           3  means that the user-supplied Subroutine RES signalled
C              DLSODIS to halt the integration and return (IRES = 2).
C              Integration as far as T was achieved with no occurrence
C              of IRES = 2, but this flag was set on attempting the
C              next step.
C          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
C              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
C              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
C              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
C              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
C              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
C              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
C              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
C              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
C          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
C              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
C              completing the requested task, but the integration
C              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
C              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
C              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
C              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
C              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
C              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
C          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
C              integration steps.  See written message for details.
C              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
C              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
C              the run to stop.
C          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
C              may be inappropriate.
C          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix.
C          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
C              integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i) = 0.0)
C              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
C              the integration was successful as far as T.
C          -7  means that the user-supplied Subroutine RES set
C              its error flag (IRES = 3) despite repeated tries by
C              DLSODIS to avoid that condition.
C          -8  means that ISTATE was 0 on input but DLSODIS was unable
C              to compute the initial value of dy/dt.  See the
C              printed message for details.
C          -9  means a fatal error return flag came from the sparse
C              solver CDRV by way of DPRJIS or DSOLSS (numerical
C              factorization or backsolve).  This should never happen.
C              The integration was successful as far as T.
C
C          Note: An error return with ISTATE = -1, -4, or -5
C          may mean that the sparsity structure of the
C          problem has changed significantly since it was last
C          determined (or input).  In that case, one can attempt to
C          complete the integration by setting ISTATE = 3 on the next
C          call, so that a new structure determination is done.
C
C          Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
C          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
C          similarly, ISTATE (= 3) need not be reset if RES told
C          DLSODIS to return because the calling program must change
C          the parameters of the problem.
C          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
C          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
C          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
C          calling the solver again.
C
C IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
C          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
C          The optional inputs are listed separately below.
C          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
C                   Default values will be used in all cases.
C          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
C
C RWORK  = a work array used for a mixture of real (double precision)
C          and integer work space.
C          The length of RWORK (in real words) must be at least
C             20 + NYH*(MAXORD + 1) + 3*NEQ + LWM    where
C          NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
C          MAXORD = 12 (if METH = 1) or 5 (if METH = 2) (unless a
C                   smaller value is given as an optional input),
C          LWM = 2*NNZ + 2*NEQ + (NNZ+9*NEQ)/LENRAT   if MITER = 1,
C          LWM = 2*NNZ + 2*NEQ + (NNZ+10*NEQ)/LENRAT  if MITER = 2.
C          in the above formulas,
C          NNZ    = number of nonzero elements in the iteration matrix
C                   P = A - con*J  (con is a constant and J is the
C                   Jacobian matrix dr/dy).
C          LENRAT = the real to integer wordlength ratio (usually 1 in
C                   single precision and 2 in double precision).
C          (See the MF description for METH and MITER.)
C          Thus if MAXORD has its default value and NEQ is constant,
C          the minimum length of RWORK is:
C             20 + 16*NEQ + LWM  for MF = 11, 111, 311, 12, 212, 412,
C             20 +  9*NEQ + LWM  for MF = 21, 121, 321, 22, 222, 422.
C          The above formula for LWM is only a crude lower bound.
C          The required length of RWORK cannot be readily predicted
C          in general, as it depends on the sparsity structure
C          of the problem.  Some experimentation may be necessary.
C
C          The first 20 words of RWORK are reserved for conditional
C          and optional inputs and optional outputs.
C
C          The following word in RWORK is a conditional input:
C            RWORK(1) = TCRIT = critical value of t which the solver
C                       is not to overshoot.  Required if ITASK is
C                       4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  (See ITASK.)
C
C LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C IWORK  = an integer work array.  The length of IWORK must be at least
C            32 + 2*NEQ + NZA + NZC   for MOSS = 0,
C            30                       for MOSS = 1 or 2,
C            31 + NEQ + NZA           for MOSS = 3 or 4.
C          (NZA is the number of nonzero elements in matrix A, and
C          NZC is the number of nonzero elements in dr/dy.)
C
C          In DLSODIS, IWORK is used for conditional and
C          optional inputs and optional outputs.
C
C          The following two blocks of words in IWORK are conditional
C          inputs, required if MOSS = 0, 3, or 4, but not otherwise
C          (see the description of MF for MOSS).
C            IWORK(30+j) = IA(j)     (j=1,...,NEQ+1)
C            IWORK(31+NEQ+k) = JA(k) (k=1,...,NZA)
C          The two arrays IA and JA describe the sparsity structure
C          to be assumed for the matrix A.  JA contains the row
C          indices where nonzero elements occur, reading in columnwise
C          order, and IA contains the starting locations in JA of the
C          descriptions of columns 1,...,NEQ, in that order, with
C          IA(1) = 1.  Thus, for each column index j = 1,...,NEQ, the
C          values of the row index i in column j where a nonzero
C          element may occur are given by
C            i = JA(k),  where   IA(j) .le. k .lt. IA(j+1).
C          If NZA is the total number of nonzero locations assumed,
C          then the length of the JA array is NZA, and IA(NEQ+1) must
C          be NZA + 1.  Duplicate entries are not allowed.
C          The following additional blocks of words are required
C          if MOSS = 0, but not otherwise.  If LC = 31 + NEQ + NZA, then
C            IWORK(LC+j) = IC(j)       (j=1,...,NEQ+1), and
C            IWORK(LC+NEQ+1+k) = JC(k) (k=1,...,NZC)
C          The two arrays IC and JC describe the sparsity
C          structure to be assumed for the Jacobian matrix dr/dy.
C          They are used in the same manner as the above IA and JA
C          arrays.  If NZC is the number of nonzero locations
C          assumed, then the length of the JC array is NZC, and
C          IC(NEQ+1) must be NZC + 1.  Duplicate entries are not
C          allowed.
C
C LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C Note:  The work arrays must not be altered between calls to DLSODIS
C for the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and
C optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
C The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
C available for use by the user outside DLSODIS between calls, if
C desired (but not for use by RES, ADDA, or JAC).
C
C MF     = the method flag.  Used only for input.
C          MF has three decimal digits-- MOSS, METH, and MITER.
C          For standard options:
C             MF = 100*MOSS + 10*METH + MITER.
C          MOSS indicates the method to be used to obtain the sparsity
C          structure of the Jacobian matrix:
C            MOSS = 0 means the user has supplied IA, JA, IC, and JC
C                     (see descriptions under IWORK above).
C            MOSS = 1 means the user has supplied JAC (see below) and
C                     the structure will be obtained from NEQ initial
C                     calls to JAC and NEQ initial calls to ADDA.
C            MOSS = 2 means the structure will be obtained from NEQ+1
C                     initial calls to RES and NEQ initial calls to ADDA
C            MOSS = 3 like MOSS = 1, except user has supplied IA and JA.
C            MOSS = 4 like MOSS = 2, except user has supplied IA and JA.
C          METH indicates the basic linear multistep method:
C            METH = 1 means the implicit Adams method.
C            METH = 2 means the method based on Backward
C                     Differentiation Formulas (BDFs).
C              The BDF method is strongly preferred for stiff problems,
C            while the Adams method is preferred when the problem is
C            not stiff.  If the matrix A(t,y) is nonsingular,
C            stiffness here can be taken to mean that of the explicit
C            ODE system dy/dt = A-inverse * g.  If A is singular,
C            the concept of stiffness is not well defined.
C              If you do not know whether the problem is stiff, we
C            recommend using METH = 2.  If it is stiff, the advantage
C            of METH = 2 over METH = 1 will be great, while if it is
C            not stiff, the advantage of METH = 1 will be slight.
C            If maximum efficiency is important, some experimentation
C            with METH may be necessary.
C          MITER indicates the corrector iteration method:
C            MITER = 1 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
C                      sparse Jacobian, given by Subroutine JAC.
C            MITER = 2 means chord iteration with an internally
C                      generated (difference quotient) sparse
C                      Jacobian (using NGP extra calls to RES per
C                      dr/dy value, where NGP is an optional
C                      output described below.)
C            If MITER = 1 or MOSS = 1 or 3 the user must supply a
C            Subroutine JAC (the name is arbitrary) as described above
C            under JAC.  Otherwise, a dummy argument can be used.
C
C          The standard choices for MF are:
C            MF = 21 or 22 for a stiff problem with IA/JA and IC/JC
C                 supplied,
C            MF = 121 for a stiff problem with JAC supplied, but not
C                 IA/JA or IC/JC,
C            MF = 222 for a stiff problem with neither IA/JA, IC/JC/,
C                 nor JAC supplied,
C            MF = 321 for a stiff problem with IA/JA and JAC supplied,
C                 but not IC/JC,
C            MF = 422 for a stiff problem with IA/JA supplied, but not
C                 IC/JC or JAC.
C
C          The sparseness structure can be changed during the problem
C          by making a call to DLSODIS with ISTATE = 3.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Inputs.
C
C The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
C call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
C this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
C location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
C The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
C case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
C of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
C Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
C locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
C then set those of interest to nonzero values.
C
C Name    Location      Meaning and Default Value
C
C H0      RWORK(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
C                   The default value is determined by the solver.
C
C HMAX    RWORK(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is infinite.
C
C HMIN    RWORK(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
C                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
C                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
C
C MAXORD  IWORK(5)  the maximum order to be allowed.  The default
C                   value is 12 if METH = 1, and 5 if METH = 2.
C                   If MAXORD exceeds the default value, it will
C                   be reduced to the default value.
C                   If MAXORD is changed during the problem, it may
C                   cause the current order to be reduced.
C
C MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
C                   allowed during one call to the solver.
C                   The default value is 500.
C
C MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
C                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
C                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
C                   value.  The default value is 10.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Outputs.
C
C As optional additional output from DLSODIS, the variables listed
C below are quantities related to the performance of DLSODIS
C which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
C the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
C Except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
C on any successful return from DLSODIS, and on any return with
C ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, -6, or -7.  On a return with -3 (illegal
C input) or -8, they will be unchanged from their existing values
C (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
C On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
C as noted below.
C
C Name    Location      Meaning
C
C HU      RWORK(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
C
C HCUR    RWORK(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
C
C TCUR    RWORK(13) the current value of the independent variable
C                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
C                   current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
C                   will always be at least as far as the argument
C                   T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
C
C TOLSF   RWORK(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
C                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
C                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
C                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
C                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
C                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
C                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
C                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
C                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
C
C NST     IWORK(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
C
C NRE     IWORK(12) the number of residual evaluations (RES calls)
C                   for the problem so far, excluding those for
C                   structure determination (MOSS = 2 or 4).
C
C NJE     IWORK(13) the number of Jacobian evaluations (each involving
C                   an evaluation of A and dr/dy) for the problem so
C                   far, excluding those for structure determination
C                   (MOSS = 1 or 3).  This equals the number of calls
C                   to ADDA and (if MITER = 1) JAC.
C
C NQU     IWORK(14) the method order last used (successfully).
C
C NQCUR   IWORK(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.
C
C IMXER   IWORK(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
C                   the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
C                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
C
C LENRW   IWORK(17) the length of RWORK actually required.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C LENIW   IWORK(18) the length of IWORK actually required.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C NNZ     IWORK(19) the number of nonzero elements in the iteration
C                   matrix  P = A - con*J  (con is a constant and
C                   J is the Jacobian matrix dr/dy).
C
C NGP     IWORK(20) the number of groups of column indices, used in
C                   difference quotient Jacobian aproximations if
C                   MITER = 2.  This is also the number of extra RES
C                   evaluations needed for each Jacobian evaluation.
C
C NLU     IWORK(21) the number of sparse LU decompositions for the
C                   problem so far. (Excludes the LU decomposition
C                   necessary when ISTATE = 0.)
C
C LYH     IWORK(22) the base address in RWORK of the history array YH,
C                   described below in this list.
C
C IPIAN   IWORK(23) the base address of the structure descriptor array
C                   IAN, described below in this list.
C
C IPJAN   IWORK(24) the base address of the structure descriptor array
C                   JAN, described below in this list.
C
C NZL     IWORK(25) the number of nonzero elements in the strict lower
C                   triangle of the LU factorization used in the chord
C                   iteration.
C
C NZU     IWORK(26) the number of nonzero elements in the strict upper
C                   triangle of the LU factorization used in the chord
C                   iteration.  The total number of nonzeros in the
C                   factorization is therefore NZL + NZU + NEQ.
C
C The following four arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
C may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
C For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
C its base address, and its description.
C For YH and ACOR, the base addresses are in RWORK (a real array).
C The integer arrays IAN and JAN are to be obtained by declaring an
C integer array IWK and identifying IWK(1) with RWORK(21), using either
C an equivalence statement or a subroutine call.  Then the base
C addresses IPIAN (of IAN) and IPJAN (of JAN) in IWK are to be obtained
C as optional outputs IWORK(23) and IWORK(24), respectively.
C Thus IAN(1) is IWK(ipian), etc.
C
C Name    Base Address      Description
C
C IAN    IPIAN (in IWK)  structure descriptor array of size NEQ + 1.
C JAN    IPJAN (in IWK)  structure descriptor array of size NNZ.
C         (see above)    IAN and JAN together describe the sparsity
C                        structure of the iteration matrix
C                          P = A - con*J,  as used by DLSODIS.
C                        JAN contains the row indices of the nonzero
C                        locations, reading in columnwise order, and
C                        IAN contains the starting locations in JAN of
C                        the descriptions of columns 1,...,NEQ, in
C                        that order, with IAN(1) = 1.  Thus for each
C                        j = 1,...,NEQ, the row indices i of the
C                        nonzero locations in column j are
C                        i = JAN(k),  IAN(j) .le. k .lt. IAN(j+1).
C                        Note that IAN(NEQ+1) = NNZ + 1.
C YH      LYH            the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
C          (optional     (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
C           output)      of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
C                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
C                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
C                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
C                        evaluated at t = TCUR.  The base address LYH
C                        is another optional output, listed above.
C
C ACOR     LENRW-NEQ+1   array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
C                        corrections on each step, scaled on output to
C                        represent the estimated local error in y on the
C                        last step.  This is the vector E in the
C                        description of the error control. It is defined
C                        only on a return from DLSODIS with ISTATE = 2.

C Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.
C
C The following are optional calls which the user may make to
C gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSODIS.
C (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
C SLATEC error handling package.)
C
C     Form of Call                  Function
C   CALL XSETUN(LUN)          Set the logical unit number, LUN, for
C                             output of messages from DLSODIS, if
C                             The default is not desired.
C                             The default value of LUN is 6.
C
C   CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         Set a flag to control the printing of
C                             messages by DLSODIS.
C                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger:
C                             This risks losing valuable information.)
C                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).
C
C                             Either of the above calls may be made at
C                             any time and will take effect immediately.
C
C   CALL DSRCMS(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) saves and restores the contents of
C                             the internal Common blocks used by
C                             DLSODIS (see Part 3 below).
C                             RSAV must be a real array of length 224
C                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
C                             array of length 71 or more.
C                             JOB=1 means save Common into RSAV/ISAV.
C                             JOB=2 means restore Common from RSAV/ISAV.
C                                DSRCMS is useful if one is
C                             interrupting a run and restarting
C                             later, or alternating between two or
C                             more problems solved with DLSODIS.
C
C   CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        Provide derivatives of y, of various
C        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
C                             desired.  It may be called only after
C                             a successful return from DLSODIS.
C
C The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.
C The form of the call is:
C
C   LYH = IWORK(22)
C   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(LYH), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
C
C The input parameters are:
C
C T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
C             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODIS).
C             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
C             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
C K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
C             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
C             (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
C             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(t), is already provided
C             by DLSODIS directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
C             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
C LYH       = the base address of the history array YH, obtained
C             as an optional output as shown above.
C NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
C
C The output parameters are:
C
C DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
C             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
C IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
C             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
C             On an error return, a message is also written.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 3.  Common Blocks.
C
C If DLSODIS is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
C must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
C   (1) the call sequence to DLSODIS, and
C   (2) the two internal Common blocks
C         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
C                      followed by 37 integer words),
C         /DLSS01/  of length  40  (6 double precision words
C                      followed by 34 integer words).
C
C If DLSODIS is used on a system in which the contents of internal
C Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
C declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure
C that their contents are preserved.
C
C If the solution of a given problem by DLSODIS is to be interrupted
C and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
C or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
C following the return from the last DLSODIS call prior to the
C interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
C internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
C next DLSODIS call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
C blocks, use Subroutines DSRCMS (see Part 2 above).
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
C
C Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSODIS package which
C relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
C replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
C a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
C done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
C (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
C superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
C
C (a) DEWSET.
C The following subroutine is called just before each internal
C integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
C described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
C     SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
C where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODIS call sequence,
C YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
C EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
C
C If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
C (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
C in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the DVNORM
C routine (see below), and also used by DLSODIS in the computation
C of the optional output IMXER, and the increments for difference
C quotient Jacobians.
C
C In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
C the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
C are available from the history array YH, described above under
C optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
C extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
C factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
C given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
C NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
C can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
C     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
C     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
C     NQ = ILS(33)
C     NST = ILS(34)
C     H = RLS(212)
C Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
C YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
C unnecessary when NST = 0).
C
C (b) DVNORM.
C The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
C root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
C     D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
C where:
C   N = the length of the vector,
C   V = real array of length N containing the vector,
C   W = real array of length N containing weights,
C   D = SQRT( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
C DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
C EWT is as set by Subroutine DEWSET.
C
C If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
C value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSODIS.
C None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
C For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
C   -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*w(I)) for the RMS-norm, or
C   -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
C    suppressing the error control on those components of y.

C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Other routines in the DLSODIS package.
C
C In addition to Subroutine DLSODIS, the DLSODIS package includes the
C following subroutines and function routines:
C  DIPREPI  acts as an interface between DLSODIS and DPREPI, and also
C           does adjusting of work space pointers and work arrays.
C  DPREPI   is called by DIPREPI to compute sparsity and do sparse
C           matrix preprocessing.
C  DAINVGS  computes the initial value of the vector
C             dy/dt = A-inverse * g
C  ADJLR    adjusts the length of required sparse matrix work space.
C           It is called by DPREPI.
C  CNTNZU   is called by DPREPI and counts the nonzero elements in the
C           strict upper triangle of P + P-transpose.
C  JGROUP   is called by DPREPI to compute groups of Jacobian column
C           indices for use when MITER = 2.
C  DINTDY   computes an interpolated value of the y vector at t = TOUT.
C  DSTODI   is the core integrator, which does one step of the
C           integration and the associated error control.
C  DCFODE   sets all method coefficients and test constants.
C  DPRJIS   computes and preprocesses the Jacobian matrix J = dr/dy
C           and the Newton iteration matrix P = A - h*l0*J.
C  DSOLSS   manages solution of linear system in chord iteration.
C  DEWSET   sets the error weight vector EWT before each step.
C  DVNORM   computes the weighted RMS-norm of a vector.
C  DSRCMS   is a user-callable routine to save and restore
C           the contents of the internal Common blocks.
C  ODRV     constructs a reordering of the rows and columns of
C           a matrix by the minimum degree algorithm.  ODRV is a
C           driver routine which calls Subroutines MD, MDI, MDM,
C           MDP, MDU, and SRO.  See Ref. 2 for details.  (The ODRV
C           module has been modified since Ref. 2, however.)
C  CDRV     performs reordering, symbolic factorization, numerical
C           factorization, or linear system solution operations,
C           depending on a path argument IPATH.  CDRV is a
C           driver routine which calls Subroutines NROC, NSFC,
C           NNFC, NNSC, and NNTC.  See Ref. 3 for details.
C           DLSODIS uses CDRV to solve linear systems in which the
C           coefficient matrix is  P = A - con*J, where A is the
C           matrix for the linear system A(t,y)*dy/dt = g(t,y),
C           con is a scalar, and J is an approximation to
C           the Jacobian dr/dy.  Because CDRV deals with rowwise
C           sparsity descriptions, CDRV works with P-transpose, not P.
C           DLSODIS also uses CDRV to solve the linear system
C             A(t,y)*dy/dt = g(t,y)  for dy/dt when ISTATE = 0.
C           (For this, CDRV works with A-transpose, not A.)
C  DUMACH   computes the unit roundoff in a machine-independent manner.
C  XERRWD, XSETUN, XSETF, IXSAV, and IUMACH  handle the printing of all
C           error messages and warnings.  XERRWD is machine-dependent.
C Note:  DVNORM, DUMACH, IXSAV, and IUMACH are function routines.
C All the others are subroutines.

C arrays.  Pointers to RWORK/IWORK segments are named by prefixing L to
C the name of the segment.  E.g., the segment YH starts at RWORK(LYH).
C Segments of RWORK (in order) are denoted  WM, YH, SAVR, EWT, ACOR.
C The required length of the matrix work space WM is not yet known,
C and so a crude minimum value is used for the initial tests of LRW
C and LIW, and YH is temporarily stored as far to the right in RWORK
C as possible, to leave the maximum amount of space for WM for matrix
C preprocessing.  Thus if MOSS .ne. 2 or 4, some of the segments of
C RWORK are temporarily omitted, as they are not needed in the
C preprocessing.  These omitted segments are: ACOR if ISTATE = 1,
C EWT and ACOR if ISTATE = 3 and MOSS = 1, and SAVR, EWT, and ACOR if
C ISTATE = 3 and MOSS = 0.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  DCFODE is called by the integrator routine to set coefficients
C  needed there.  The coefficients for the current method, as
C  given by the value of METH, are set for all orders and saved.
C  The maximum order assumed here is 12 if METH = 1 and 5 if METH = 2.
C  (A smaller value of the maximum order is also allowed.)
C  DCFODE is called once at the beginning of the problem,
C  and is not called again unless and until METH is changed.
C
C  The ELCO array contains the basic method coefficients.
C  The coefficients el(i), 1 .le. i .le. nq+1, for the method of
C  order nq are stored in ELCO(i,nq).  They are given by a genetrating
C  polynomial, i.e.,
C      l(x) = el(1) + el(2)*x + ... + el(nq+1)*x**nq.
C  For the implicit Adams methods, l(x) is given by
C      dl/dx = (x+1)*(x+2)*...*(x+nq-1)/factorial(nq-1),    l(-1) = 0.
C  For the BDF methods, l(x) is given by
C      l(x) = (x+1)*(x+2)* ... *(x+nq)/K,
C  where         K = factorial(nq)*(1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/nq).
C
C  The TESCO array contains test constants used for the
C  local error test and the selection of step size and/or order.
C  At order nq, TESCO(k,nq) is used for the selection of step
C  size at order nq - 1 if k = 1, at order nq if k = 2, and at order
C  nq + 1 if k = 3.

C***TYPE      DOUBLE PRECISION (SINTDY-S, DINTDY-D)
C***AUTHOR  Hindmarsh, Alan C., (LLNL)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  DINTDY computes interpolated values of the K-th derivative of the
C  dependent variable vector y, and stores it in DKY.  This routine
C  is called within the package with K = 0 and T = TOUT, but may
C  also be called by the user for any K up to the current order.
C  (See detailed instructions in the usage documentation.)
C
C  The computed values in DKY are gotten by interpolation using the
C  Nordsieck history array YH.  This array corresponds uniquely to a
C  vector-valued polynomial of degree NQCUR or less, and DKY is set
C  to the K-th derivative of this polynomial at T.
C  The formula for DKY is:
C               q
C   DKY(i)  =  sum  c(j,K) * (T - tn)**(j-K) * h**(-j) * YH(i,j+1)
C              j=K
C  where  c(j,K) = j*(j-1)*...*(j-K+1), q = NQCUR, tn = TCUR, h = HCUR.
C  The quantities  nq = NQCUR, l = nq+1, N = NEQ, tn, and h are
C  communicated by COMMON.  The above sum is done in reverse order.
C  IFLAG is returned negative if either K or T is out of bounds.

C***PURPOSE  Compute and process Newton iteration matrix.
C***TYPE      DOUBLE PRECISION (SPREPJ-S, DPREPJ-D)
C***AUTHOR  Hindmarsh, Alan C., (LLNL)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  DPREPJ is called by DSTODE to compute and process the matrix
C  P = I - h*el(1)*J , where J is an approximation to the Jacobian.
C  Here J is computed by the user-supplied routine JAC if
C  MITER = 1 or 4, or by finite differencing if MITER = 2, 3, or 5.
C  If MITER = 3, a diagonal approximation to J is used.
C  J is stored in WM and replaced by P.  If MITER .ne. 3, P is then
C  subjected to LU decomposition in preparation for later solution
C  of linear systems with P as coefficient matrix.  This is done
C  by DGEFA if MITER = 1 or 2, and by DGBFA if MITER = 4 or 5.
C
C  In addition to variables described in DSTODE and DLSODE prologues,
C  communication with DPREPJ uses the following:
C  Y     = array containing predicted values on entry.
C  FTEM  = work array of length N (ACOR in DSTODE).
C  SAVF  = array containing f evaluated at predicted y.
C  WM    = real work space for matrices.  On output it contains the
C          inverse diagonal matrix if MITER = 3 and the LU decomposition
C          of P if MITER is 1, 2 , 4, or 5.
C          Storage of matrix elements starts at WM(3).
C          WM also contains the following matrix-related data:
C          WM(1) = SQRT(UROUND), used in numerical Jacobian increments.
C          WM(2) = H*EL0, saved for later use if MITER = 3.
C  IWM   = integer work space containing pivot information, starting at
C          IWM(21), if MITER is 1, 2, 4, or 5.  IWM also contains band
C          parameters ML = IWM(1) and MU = IWM(2) if MITER is 4 or 5.
C  EL0   = EL(1) (input).
C  IERPJ = output error flag,  = 0 if no trouble, .gt. 0 if
C          P matrix found to be singular.
C  JCUR  = output flag = 1 to indicate that the Jacobian matrix
C          (or approximation) is now current.
C  This routine also uses the COMMON variables EL0, H, TN, UROUND,
C  MITER, N, NFE, and NJE.

C  If MITER is 4 or 5, it calls DGBSL.
C  Communication with DSOLSY uses the following variables:
C  WM    = real work space containing the inverse diagonal matrix if
C          MITER = 3 and the LU decomposition of the matrix otherwise.
C          Storage of matrix elements starts at WM(3).
C          WM also contains the following matrix-related data:
C          WM(1) = SQRT(UROUND) (not used here),
C          WM(2) = HL0, the previous value of h*EL0, used if MITER = 3.
C  IWM   = integer work space containing pivot information, starting at
C          IWM(21), if MITER is 1, 2, 4, or 5.  IWM also contains band
C          parameters ML = IWM(1) and MU = IWM(2) if MITER is 4 or 5.
C  X     = the right-hand side vector on input, and the solution vector
C          on output, of length N.
C  TEM   = vector of work space of length N, not used in this version.
C  IERSL = output flag (in COMMON).  IERSL = 0 if no trouble occurred.
C          IERSL = 1 if a singular matrix arose with MITER = 3.
C  This routine also uses the COMMON variables EL0, H, MITER, and N.

C***SUBSIDIARY
C***PURPOSE  Performs one step of an ODEPACK integration.
C***TYPE      DOUBLE PRECISION (SSTODE-S, DSTODE-D)
C***AUTHOR  Hindmarsh, Alan C., (LLNL)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  DSTODE performs one step of the integration of an initial value
C  problem for a system of ordinary differential equations.
C  Note:  DSTODE is independent of the value of the iteration method
C  indicator MITER, when this is .ne. 0, and hence is independent
C  of the type of chord method used, or the Jacobian structure.
C  Communication with DSTODE is done with the following variables:
C
C  NEQ    = integer array containing problem size in NEQ(1), and
C           passed as the NEQ argument in all calls to F and JAC.
C  Y      = an array of length .ge. N used as the Y argument in
C           all calls to F and JAC.
C  YH     = an NYH by LMAX array containing the dependent variables
C           and their approximate scaled derivatives, where
C           LMAX = MAXORD + 1.  YH(i,j+1) contains the approximate
C           j-th derivative of y(i), scaled by h**j/factorial(j)
C           (j = 0,1,...,NQ).  on entry for the first step, the first
C           two columns of YH must be set from the initial values.
C  NYH    = a constant integer .ge. N, the first dimension of YH.
C  YH1    = a one-dimensional array occupying the same space as YH.
C  EWT    = an array of length N containing multiplicative weights
C           for local error measurements.  Local errors in Y(i) are
C           compared to 1.0/EWT(i) in various error tests.
C  SAVF   = an array of working storage, of length N.
C           Also used for input of YH(*,MAXORD+2) when JSTART = -1
C           and MAXORD .lt. the current order NQ.
C  ACOR   = a work array of length N, used for the accumulated
C           corrections.  On a successful return, ACOR(i) contains
C           the estimated one-step local error in Y(i).
C  WM,IWM = real and integer work arrays associated with matrix
C           operations in chord iteration (MITER .ne. 0).
C  PJAC   = name of routine to evaluate and preprocess Jacobian matrix
C           and P = I - h*el0*JAC, if a chord method is being used.
C  SLVS   = name of routine to solve linear system in chord iteration.
C  CCMAX  = maximum relative change in h*el0 before PJAC is called.
C  H      = the step size to be attempted on the next step.
C           H is altered by the error control algorithm during the
C           problem.  H can be either positive or negative, but its
C           sign must remain constant throughout the problem.
C  HMIN   = the minimum absolute value of the step size h to be used.
C  HMXI   = inverse of the maximum absolute value of h to be used.
C           HMXI = 0.0 is allowed and corresponds to an infinite hmax.
C           HMIN and HMXI may be changed at any time, but will not
C           take effect until the next change of h is considered.
C  TN     = the independent variable. TN is updated on each step taken.
C  JSTART = an integer used for input only, with the following
C           values and meanings:
C                0  perform the first step.
C            .gt.0  take a new step continuing from the last.
C               -1  take the next step with a new value of H, MAXORD,
C                     N, METH, MITER, and/or matrix parameters.
C               -2  take the next step with a new value of H,
C                     but with other inputs unchanged.
C           On return, JSTART is set to 1 to facilitate continuation.
C  KFLAG  = a completion code with the following meanings:
C                0  the step was succesful.
C               -1  the requested error could not be achieved.
C               -2  corrector convergence could not be achieved.
C               -3  fatal error in PJAC or SLVS.
C           A return with KFLAG = -1 or -2 means either
C           abs(H) = HMIN or 10 consecutive failures occurred.
C           On a return with KFLAG negative, the values of TN and
C           the YH array are as of the beginning of the last
C           step, and H is the last step size attempted.
C  MAXORD = the maximum order of integration method to be allowed.
C  MAXCOR = the maximum number of corrector iterations allowed.
C  MSBP   = maximum number of steps between PJAC calls (MITER .gt. 0).
C  MXNCF  = maximum number of convergence failures allowed.
C  METH/MITER = the method flags.  See description in driver.
C  N      = the number of first-order differential equations.
C  The values of CCMAX, H, HMIN, HMXI, TN, JSTART, KFLAG, MAXORD,
C  MAXCOR, MSBP, MXNCF, METH, MITER, and N are communicated via COMMON.

C  * compute grouping of column indices (MITER = 2),
C  * compute a new ordering of rows and columns of the matrix,
C  * reorder JA corresponding to the new ordering,

C DPRJS is called to compute and process the matrix
C P = I - H*EL(1)*J , where J is an approximation to the Jacobian.
C J is computed by columns, either by the user-supplied routine JAC
C if MITER = 1, or by finite differencing if MITER = 2.
C if MITER = 3, a diagonal approximation to J is used.
C if MITER = 1 or 2, and if the existing value of the Jacobian
C (as contained in P) is considered acceptable, then a new value of
C P is reconstructed from the old value.  In any case, when MITER
C is 1 or 2, the P matrix is subjected to LU decomposition in CDRV.
C P and its LU decomposition are stored (separately) in WK.
C
C In addition to variables described previously, communication
C with DPRJS uses the following:
C Y     = array containing predicted values on entry.
C FTEM  = work array of length N (ACOR in DSTODE).
C SAVF  = array containing f evaluated at predicted y.
C WK    = real work space for matrices.  On output it contains the
C         inverse diagonal matrix if MITER = 3, and P and its sparse
C         LU decomposition if MITER is 1 or 2.
C         Storage of matrix elements starts at WK(3).
C         WK also contains the following matrix-related data:
C         WK(1) = SQRT(UROUND), used in numerical Jacobian increments.
C         WK(2) = H*EL0, saved for later use if MITER = 3.
C IWK   = integer work space for matrix-related data, assumed to
C         be equivalenced to WK.  In addition, WK(IPRSP) and IWK(IPISP)
C         are assumed to have identical locations.
C EL0   = EL(1) (input).
C IERPJ = output error flag (in Common).
C       = 0 if no error.
C       = 1  if zero pivot found in CDRV.
C       = 2  if a singular matrix arose with MITER = 3.
C       = -1 if insufficient storage for CDRV (should not occur here).
C       = -2 if other error found in CDRV (should not occur here).
C JCUR  = output flag showing status of (approximate) Jacobian matrix:
C          = 1 to indicate that the Jacobian is now current, or
C          = 0 to indicate that a saved value was used.
C This routine also uses other variables in Common.

c  description
c
c    odrv finds a minimum degree ordering of the rows and columns
c    of a matrix m stored in (ia,ja,a) format (see below).  for the
c    reordered matrix, the work and storage required to perform
c    gaussian elimination is (usually) significantly less.
c
c    note.. odrv and its subordinate routines have been modified to
c    compute orderings for general matrices, not necessarily having any
c    symmetry.  the miminum degree ordering is computed for the
c    structure of the symmetric matrix  m + m-transpose.
c    modifications to the original odrv module have been made in
c    the coding in subroutine mdi, and in the initial comments in
c    subroutines odrv and md.
c
c    if only the nonzero entries in the upper triangle of m are being
c    stored, then odrv symmetrically reorders (ia,ja,a), (optionally)
c    with the diagonal entries placed first in each row.  this is to
c    ensure that if m(i,j) will be in the upper triangle of m with
c    respect to the new ordering, then m(i,j) is stored in row i (and
c    thus m(j,i) is not stored),  whereas if m(i,j) will be in the
c    strict lower triangle of m, then m(j,i) is stored in row j (and
c    thus m(i,j) is not stored).
c
c
c  storage of sparse matrices
c
c    the nonzero entries of the matrix m are stored row-by-row in the
c    array a.  to identify the individual nonzero entries in each row,
c    we need to know in which column each entry lies.  these column
c    indices are stored in the array ja.  i.e., if  a(k) = m(i,j),  then
c    ja(k) = j.  to identify the individual rows, we need to know where
c    each row starts.  these row pointers are stored in the array ia.
c    i.e., if m(i,j) is the first nonzero entry (stored) in the i-th row
c    and  a(k) = m(i,j),  then  ia(i) = k.  moreover, ia(n+1) points to
c    the first location following the last element in the last row.
c    thus, the number of entries in the i-th row is  ia(i+1) - ia(i),
c    the nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored consecutively in
c
c            a(ia(i)),  a(ia(i)+1),  ..., a(ia(i+1)-1),
c
c    and the corresponding column indices are stored consecutively in
c
c            ja(ia(i)), ja(ia(i)+1), ..., ja(ia(i+1)-1).
c
c    when the coefficient matrix is symmetric, only the nonzero entries
c    in the upper triangle need be stored.  for example, the matrix
c
c             ( 1  0  2  3  0 )
c             ( 0  4  0  0  0 )
c         m = ( 2  0  5  6  0 )
c             ( 3  0  6  7  8 )
c             ( 0  0  0  8  9 )
c
c    could be stored as
c
c            - 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13

c ------+----------
c       -
c         the nonzero entries of the coefficient matrix m are stored
c    row-by-row in the array a.  to identify the individual nonzero
c    entries in each row, we need to know in which column each entry
c    lies.  the column indices which correspond to the nonzero entries
c    of m are stored in the array ja.  i.e., if  a(k) = m(i,j),  then
c    ja(k) = j.  in addition, we need to know where each row starts and
c    how long it is.  the index positions in ja and a where the rows of
c    m begin are stored in the array ia.  i.e., if m(i,j) is the first
c    nonzero entry (stored) in the i-th row and a(k) = m(i,j),  then
c    ia(i) = k.  moreover, the index in ja and a of the first location
c    following the last element in the last row is stored in ia(n+1).
c    thus, the number of entries in the i-th row is given by
c    ia(i+1) - ia(i),  the nonzero entries of the i-th row are stored
c    consecutively in
c            a(ia(i)),  a(ia(i)+1),  ..., a(ia(i+1)-1),
c    and the corresponding column indices are stored consecutively in
c            ja(ia(i)), ja(ia(i)+1), ..., ja(ia(i+1)-1).
c    for example, the 5 by 5 matrix

c         the rows and columns of the original matrix m can be

c    before calling the driver.  if no reordering is done, then set
c    r(i) = c(i) = ic(i) = i  for i=1,...,n.  the solution z is returned
c    in the original order.
c         if the columns have been reordered (i.e.,  c(i).ne.i  for some
c    i), then the driver will call a subroutine (nroc) which rearranges
c    each row of ja and a, leaving the rows in the original order, but
c    placing the elements of each row in increasing order with respect
c    to the new ordering.  if  path.ne.1,  then nroc is assumed to have

c
c         the solution of the system of linear equations is divided into
c    three stages --
c      nsfc -- the matrix m is processed symbolically to determine where
c               fillin will occur during the numeric factorization.
c      nnfc -- the matrix m is factored numerically into the product ldu
c               of a unit lower triangular matrix l, a diagonal matrix
c               d, and a unit upper triangular matrix u, and the system
c               mx = b  is solved.
c      nnsc -- the linear system  mx = b  is solved using the ldu
c  or           factorization from nnfc.
c      nntc -- the transposed linear system  mt x = b  is solved using
c               the ldu factorization from nnf.
c    for several systems whose coefficient matrices have the same
c    nonzero structure, nsfc need be done only once (for the first
c    system).  then nnfc is done once for each additional system.  for
c    several systems with the same coefficient matrix, nsfc and nnfc
c    need be done only once (for the first system).  then nnsc or nntc
c    is done once for each additional right-hand side.

c
c    i.   calling sequences
c         the coefficient matrix can be processed by an ordering routine
c    (e.g., to reduce fillin or ensure numerical stability) before using
c    the remaining subroutines.  if no reordering is done, then set
c    r(i) = c(i) = ic(i) = i  for i=1,...,n.  if an ordering subroutine
c    is used, then nroc should be used to reorder the coefficient matrix
c    the calling sequence is --
c        (       (matrix ordering))
c        (nroc   (matrix reordering))
c         nsfc   (symbolic factorization to determine where fillin will
c                  occur during numeric factorization)
c         nnfc   (numeric factorization into product ldu of unit lower
c                  triangular matrix l, diagonal matrix d, and unit
c                  upper triangular matrix u, and solution of linear
c                  system)
c         nnsc   (solution of linear system for additional right-hand
c                  side using ldu factorization from nnfc)
c    (if only one system of equations is to be solved, then the
c    subroutine trk should be used.)
c
c    ii.  storage of sparse matrices
c         the nonzero entries of the coefficient matrix m are stored
c    row-by-row in the array a.  to identify the individual nonzero
c    entries in each row, we need to know in which column each entry
c    lies.  the column indices which correspond to the nonzero entries
c    of m are stored in the array ja.  i.e., if  a(k) = m(i,j),  then
c    ja(k) = j.  in addition, we need to know where each row starts and
c    how long it is.  the index positions in ja and a where the rows of
c    m begin are stored in the array ia.  i.e., if m(i,j) is the first
c    (leftmost) entry in the i-th row and  a(k) = m(i,j),  then
c    ia(i) = k.  moreover, the index in ja and a of the first location
c    following the last element in the last row is stored in ia(n+1).
c    thus, the number of entries in the i-th row is given by
c    ia(i+1) - ia(i),  the nonzero entries of the i-th row are stored
c    consecutively in
c            a(ia(i)),  a(ia(i)+1),  ..., a(ia(i+1)-1),
c    and the corresponding column indices are stored consecutively in
c            ja(ia(i)), ja(ia(i)+1), ..., ja(ia(i+1)-1).
c    for example, the 5 by 5 matrix
c                ( 1. 0. 2. 0. 0.)
c                ( 0. 3. 0. 0. 0.)
c            m = ( 0. 4. 5. 6. 0.)
c                ( 0. 0. 0. 7. 0.)
c                ( 0. 0. 0. 8. 9.)
c    would be stored as
c               - 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
c            ---+--------------------------
c            ia - 1  3  4  7  8 10
c            ja - 1  3  2  2  3  4  4  4  5
c             a - 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.         .
c
c         the strict upper (lower) triangular portion of the matrix
c    u (l) is stored in a similar fashion using the arrays  iu, ju, u
c    (il, jl, l)  except that an additional array iju (ijl) is used to
c    compress storage of ju (jl) by allowing some sequences of column
c    (row) indices to used for more than one row (column)  (n.b., l is
c    stored by columns).  iju(k) (ijl(k)) points to the starting
c    location in ju (jl) of entries for the kth row (column).
c    compression in ju (jl) occurs in two ways.  first, if a row
c    (column) i was merged into the current row (column) k, and the
c    number of elements merged in from (the tail portion of) row
c    (column) i is the same as the final length of row (column) k, then
c    the kth row (column) and the tail of row (column) i are identical
c    and iju(k) (ijl(k)) points to the start of the tail.  second, if
c    some tail portion of the (k-1)st row (column) is identical to the
c    head of the kth row (column), then iju(k) (ijl(k)) points to the
c    start of that tail portion.  for example, the nonzero structure of
c    the strict upper triangular part of the matrix
c            d 0 x x x
c            0 d 0 x x
c            0 0 d x 0
c            0 0 0 d x
c            0 0 0 0 d
c    would be represented as
c                - 1 2 3 4 5 6
c            ----+------------
c             iu - 1 4 6 7 8 8
c             ju - 3 4 5 4
c            iju - 1 2 4 3           .
c    the diagonal entries of l and u are assumed to be equal to one and
c    are not stored.  the array d contains the reciprocals of the
c    diagonal entries of the matrix d.
c
c    iii. additional storage savings
c         in nsfc, r and ic can be the same array in the calling
c    sequence if no reordering of the coefficient matrix has been done.
c         in nnfc, r, c, and ic can all be the same array if no
c    reordering has been done.  if only the rows have been reordered,
c    then c and ic can be the same array.  if the row and column
c    orderings are the same, then r and c can be the same array.  z and
c    row can be the same array.
c         in nnsc or nntc, r and c can be the same array if no
c    reordering has been done or if the row and column orderings are the
c    same.  z and b can be the same array.  however, then b will be
c    destroyed.

C DSTODA performs one step of the integration of an initial value
C problem for a system of ordinary differential equations.
C Note: DSTODA is independent of the value of the iteration method
C indicator MITER, when this is .ne. 0, and hence is independent
C of the type of chord method used, or the Jacobian structure.
C Communication with DSTODA is done with the following variables:
C
C Y      = an array of length .ge. N used as the Y argument in
C          all calls to F and JAC.
C NEQ    = integer array containing problem size in NEQ(1), and
C          passed as the NEQ argument in all calls to F and JAC.
C YH     = an NYH by LMAX array containing the dependent variables
C          and their approximate scaled derivatives, where
C          LMAX = MAXORD + 1.  YH(i,j+1) contains the approximate
C          j-th derivative of y(i), scaled by H**j/factorial(j)
C          (j = 0,1,...,NQ).  On entry for the first step, the first
C          two columns of YH must be set from the initial values.
C NYH    = a constant integer .ge. N, the first dimension of YH.
C YH1    = a one-dimensional array occupying the same space as YH.
C EWT    = an array of length N containing multiplicative weights
C          for local error measurements.  Local errors in y(i) are
C          compared to 1.0/EWT(i) in various error tests.
C SAVF   = an array of working storage, of length N.
C ACOR   = a work array of length N, used for the accumulated
C          corrections.  On a successful return, ACOR(i) contains
C          the estimated one-step local error in y(i).
C WM,IWM = real and integer work arrays associated with matrix
C          operations in chord iteration (MITER .ne. 0).
C PJAC   = name of routine to evaluate and preprocess Jacobian matrix
C          and P = I - H*EL0*Jac, if a chord method is being used.
C          It also returns an estimate of norm(Jac) in PDNORM.
C SLVS   = name of routine to solve linear system in chord iteration.
C CCMAX  = maximum relative change in H*EL0 before PJAC is called.
C H      = the step size to be attempted on the next step.
C          H is altered by the error control algorithm during the
C          problem.  H can be either positive or negative, but its
C          sign must remain constant throughout the problem.
C HMIN   = the minimum absolute value of the step size H to be used.
C HMXI   = inverse of the maximum absolute value of H to be used.
C          HMXI = 0.0 is allowed and corresponds to an infinite HMAX.
C          HMIN and HMXI may be changed at any time, but will not
C          take effect until the next change of H is considered.
C TN     = the independent variable. TN is updated on each step taken.
C JSTART = an integer used for input only, with the following
C          values and meanings:
C               0  perform the first step.
C           .gt.0  take a new step continuing from the last.
C              -1  take the next step with a new value of H,
C                    N, METH, MITER, and/or matrix parameters.
C              -2  take the next step with a new value of H,
C                    but with other inputs unchanged.
C          On return, JSTART is set to 1 to facilitate continuation.
C KFLAG  = a completion code with the following meanings:
C               0  the step was succesful.
C              -1  the requested error could not be achieved.
C              -2  corrector convergence could not be achieved.
C              -3  fatal error in PJAC or SLVS.
C          A return with KFLAG = -1 or -2 means either
C          ABS(H) = HMIN or 10 consecutive failures occurred.
C          On a return with KFLAG negative, the values of TN and
C          the YH array are as of the beginning of the last
C          step, and H is the last step size attempted.
C MAXORD = the maximum order of integration method to be allowed.
C MAXCOR = the maximum number of corrector iterations allowed.
C MSBP   = maximum number of steps between PJAC calls (MITER .gt. 0).
C MXNCF  = maximum number of convergence failures allowed.
C METH   = current method.
C          METH = 1 means Adams method (nonstiff)
C          METH = 2 means BDF method (stiff)
C          METH may be reset by DSTODA.
C MITER  = corrector iteration method.
C          MITER = 0 means functional iteration.
C          MITER = JT .gt. 0 means a chord iteration corresponding
C          to Jacobian type JT.  (The DLSODA/DLSODAR argument JT is
C          communicated here as JTYP, but is not used in DSTODA
C          except to load MITER following a method switch.)
C          MITER may be reset by DSTODA.
C N      = the number of first-order differential equations.

C On the first call, the order is set to 1, and other variables are
C initialized.  RMAX is the maximum ratio by which H can be increased
C in a single step.  It is initially 1.E4 to compensate for the small
C initial H, but then is normally equal to 10.  If a failure
C occurs (in corrector convergence or error test), RMAX is set at 2
C for the next increase.
C DCFODE is called to get the needed coefficients for both methods.

C DPRJA is called by DSTODA to compute and process the matrix
C P = I - H*EL(1)*J , where J is an approximation to the Jacobian.
C Here J is computed by the user-supplied routine JAC if
C MITER = 1 or 4 or by finite differencing if MITER = 2 or 5.
C J, scaled by -H*EL(1), is stored in WM.  Then the norm of J (the
C matrix norm consistent with the weighted max-norm on vectors given
C by DMNORM) is computed, and J is overwritten by P.  P is then
C subjected to LU decomposition in preparation for later solution
C of linear systems with P as coefficient matrix.  This is done
C by DGEFA if MITER = 1 or 2, and by DGBFA if MITER = 4 or 5.
C
C In addition to variables described previously, communication
C with DPRJA uses the following:
C Y     = array containing predicted values on entry.
C FTEM  = work array of length N (ACOR in DSTODA).
C SAVF  = array containing f evaluated at predicted y.
C WM    = real work space for matrices.  On output it contains the
C         LU decomposition of P.
C         Storage of matrix elements starts at WM(3).
C         WM also contains the following matrix-related data:
C         WM(1) = SQRT(UROUND), used in numerical Jacobian increments.
C IWM   = integer work space containing pivot information, starting at
C         IWM(21).   IWM also contains the band parameters
C         ML = IWM(1) and MU = IWM(2) if MITER is 4 or 5.
C EL0   = EL(1) (input).
C PDNORM= norm of Jacobian matrix. (Output).
C IERPJ = output error flag,  = 0 if no trouble, .gt. 0 if
C         P matrix found to be singular.
C JCUR  = output flag = 1 to indicate that the Jacobian matrix
C         (or approximation) is now current.

C This subroutine finds the leftmost root of a set of arbitrary
C functions gi(x) (i = 1,...,NG) in an interval (X0,X1).  Only roots
C of odd multiplicity (i.e. changes of sign of the gi) are found.
C Here the sign of X1 - X0 is arbitrary, but is constant for a given
C problem, and -leftmost- means nearest to X0.
C The values of the vector-valued function g(x) = (gi, i=1...NG)
C are communicated through the call sequence of DROOTS.
C The method used is the Illinois algorithm.

C
C Description of parameters.
C
C NG     = number of functions gi, or the number of components of
C          the vector valued function g(x).  Input only.
C
C HMIN   = resolution parameter in X.  Input only.  When a root is
C          found, it is located only to within an error of HMIN in X.
C          Typically, HMIN should be set to something on the order of
C               100 * UROUND * MAX(ABS(X0),ABS(X1)),
C          where UROUND is the unit roundoff of the machine.
C
C JFLAG  = integer flag for input and output communication.
C
C          On input, set JFLAG = 0 on the first call for the problem,
C          and leave it unchanged until the problem is completed.
C          (The problem is completed when JFLAG .ge. 2 on return.)
C
C          On output, JFLAG has the following values and meanings:
C          JFLAG = 1 means DROOTS needs a value of g(x).  Set GX = g(X)
C                    and call DROOTS again.
C          JFLAG = 2 means a root has been found.  The root is
C                    at X, and GX contains g(X).  (Actually, X is the
C                    rightmost approximation to the root on an interval
C                    (X0,X1) of size HMIN or less.)
C          JFLAG = 3 means X = X1 is a root, with one or more of the gi
C                    being zero at X1 and no sign changes in (X0,X1).
C                    GX contains g(X) on output.
C          JFLAG = 4 means no roots (of odd multiplicity) were
C                    found in (X0,X1) (no sign changes).
C
C X0,X1  = endpoints of the interval where roots are sought.
C          X1 and X0 are input when JFLAG = 0 (first call), and
C          must be left unchanged between calls until the problem is
C          completed.  X0 and X1 must be distinct, but X1 - X0 may be
C          of either sign.  However, the notion of -left- and -right-
C          will be used to mean nearer to X0 or X1, respectively.
C          When JFLAG .ge. 2 on return, X0 and X1 are output, and
C          are the endpoints of the relevant interval.
C
C G0,G1  = arrays of length NG containing the vectors g(X0) and g(X1),
C          respectively.  When JFLAG = 0, G0 and G1 are input and
C          none of the G0(i) should be zero.
C          When JFLAG .ge. 2 on return, G0 and G1 are output.
C
C GX     = array of length NG containing g(X).  GX is input
C          when JFLAG = 1, and output when JFLAG .ge. 2.
C
C X      = independent variable value.  Output only.
C          When JFLAG = 1 on output, X is the point at which g(x)
C          is to be evaluated and loaded into GX.
C          When JFLAG = 2 or 3, X is the root.
C          When JFLAG = 4, X is the right endpoint of the interval, X1.
C
C JROOT  = integer array of length NG.  Output only.
C          When JFLAG = 2 or 3, JROOT indicates which components
C          of g(x) have a root at X.  JROOT(i) is 1 if the i-th
C          component has a root, and JROOT(i) = 0 otherwise.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C DSTODPK performs one step of the integration of an initial value
C problem for a system of Ordinary Differential Equations.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C The following changes were made to generate Subroutine DSTODPK
C from Subroutine DSTODE:
C 1. The array SAVX was added to the call sequence.
C 2. PJAC and SLVS were replaced by PSOL in the call sequence.
C 3. The Common block /DLPK01/ was added for communication.
C 4. The test constant EPCON is loaded into Common below statement
C    numbers 125 and 155, and used below statement 400.
C 5. The Newton iteration counter MNEWT is set below 220 and 400.
C 6. The call to PJAC was replaced with a call to DPKSET (fixed name),
C    with a longer call sequence, called depending on JACFLG.
C 7. The corrector residual is stored in SAVX (not Y) at 360,
C    and the solution vector is in SAVX in the 380 loop.
C 8. SLVS was renamed DSOLPK and includes NEQ, SAVX, EWT, F, and JAC.
C    SAVX was added because DSOLPK now needs Y and SAVF undisturbed.
C 9. The nonlinear convergence failure count NCFN is set at 430.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Note: DSTODPK is independent of the value of the iteration method
C indicator MITER, when this is .ne. 0, and hence is independent
C of the type of chord method used, or the Jacobian structure.
C Communication with DSTODPK is done with the following variables:
C
C NEQ    = integer array containing problem size in NEQ(1), and
C          passed as the NEQ argument in all calls to F and JAC.
C Y      = an array of length .ge. N used as the Y argument in
C          all calls to F and JAC.
C YH     = an NYH by LMAX array containing the dependent variables
C          and their approximate scaled derivatives, where
C          LMAX = MAXORD + 1.  YH(i,j+1) contains the approximate
C          j-th derivative of y(i), scaled by H**j/factorial(j)
C          (j = 0,1,...,NQ).  On entry for the first step, the first
C          two columns of YH must be set from the initial values.
C NYH    = a constant integer .ge. N, the first dimension of YH.
C YH1    = a one-dimensional array occupying the same space as YH.
C EWT    = an array of length N containing multiplicative weights
C          for local error measurements.  Local errors in y(i) are
C          compared to 1.0/EWT(i) in various error tests.
C SAVF   = an array of working storage, of length N.
C          Also used for input of YH(*,MAXORD+2) when JSTART = -1
C          and MAXORD .lt. the current order NQ.
C SAVX   = an array of working storage, of length N.
C ACOR   = a work array of length N, used for the accumulated
C          corrections.  On a successful return, ACOR(i) contains
C          the estimated one-step local error in y(i).
C WM,IWM = real and integer work arrays associated with matrix
C          operations in chord iteration (MITER .ne. 0).
C CCMAX  = maximum relative change in H*EL0 before DPKSET is called.
C H      = the step size to be attempted on the next step.
C          H is altered by the error control algorithm during the
C          problem.  H can be either positive or negative, but its
C          sign must remain constant throughout the problem.
C HMIN   = the minimum absolute value of the step size H to be used.
C HMXI   = inverse of the maximum absolute value of H to be used.
C          HMXI = 0.0 is allowed and corresponds to an infinite HMAX.
C          HMIN and HMXI may be changed at any time, but will not
C          take effect until the next change of H is considered.
C TN     = the independent variable. TN is updated on each step taken.
C JSTART = an integer used for input only, with the following
C          values and meanings:
C               0  perform the first step.

C iteration.  It is called if MITER .ne. 0.
C In addition to variables described elsewhere,

C         (Krylov basis vectors, Hessenberg matrix, etc.)
C IWM   = integer work space containing data for the algorithm
C X     = the right-hand side vector on input, and the solution vector

C         IERSL =  1 means the iterative method failed to converge.
C                    If the preconditioner is out of date, the step
C                    is repeated with a new preconditioner.
C                    Otherwise, the stepsize is reduced (forcing a
C                    new evaluation of the preconditioner) and the
C                    step is repeated.
C         IERSL = -1 means there was a nonrecoverable error in the
C                    iterative solver, and an error exit occurs.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C DSTOKA performs one step of the integration of an initial value
C problem for a system of Ordinary Differential Equations.
C
C This routine was derived from Subroutine DSTODPK in the DLSODPK
C package by the addition of automatic functional/Newton iteration
C switching and logic for re-use of Jacobian data.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Note: DSTOKA is independent of the value of the iteration method
C indicator MITER, when this is .ne. 0, and hence is independent
C of the type of chord method used, or the Jacobian structure.
C Communication with DSTOKA is done with the following variables:
C
C NEQ    = integer array containing problem size in NEQ(1), and
C          passed as the NEQ argument in all calls to F and JAC.
C Y      = an array of length .ge. N used as the Y argument in
C          all calls to F and JAC.
C YH     = an NYH by LMAX array containing the dependent variables
C          and their approximate scaled derivatives, where
C          LMAX = MAXORD + 1.  YH(i,j+1) contains the approximate
C          j-th derivative of y(i), scaled by H**j/factorial(j)
C          (j = 0,1,...,NQ).  On entry for the first step, the first
C          two columns of YH must be set from the initial values.
C NYH    = a constant integer .ge. N, the first dimension of YH.
C YH1    = a one-dimensional array occupying the same space as YH.
C EWT    = an array of length N containing multiplicative weights
C          for local error measurements.  Local errors in y(i) are
C          compared to 1.0/EWT(i) in various error tests.
C SAVF   = an array of working storage, of length N.
C          Also used for input of YH(*,MAXORD+2) when JSTART = -1
C          and MAXORD .lt. the current order NQ.
C SAVX   = an array of working storage, of length N.
C ACOR   = a work array of length N, used for the accumulated
C          corrections.  On a successful return, ACOR(i) contains
C          the estimated one-step local error in y(i).
C WM,IWM = real and integer work arrays associated with matrix
C          operations in chord iteration (MITER .ne. 0).
C CCMAX  = maximum relative change in H*EL0 before DSETPK is called.
C H      = the step size to be attempted on the next step.
C          H is altered by the error control algorithm during the
C          problem.  H can be either positive or negative, but its
C          sign must remain constant throughout the problem.
C HMIN   = the minimum absolute value of the step size H to be used.
C HMXI   = inverse of the maximum absolute value of H to be used.
C          HMXI = 0.0 is allowed and corresponds to an infinite HMAX.
C          HMIN and HMXI may be changed at any time, but will not
C          take effect until the next change of H is considered.
C TN     = the independent variable. TN is updated on each step taken.
C JSTART = an integer used for input only, with the following
C          values and meanings:
C               0  perform the first step.
C           .gt.0  take a new step continuing from the last.
C              -1  take the next step with a new value of H, MAXORD,
C                    N, METH, MITER, and/or matrix parameters.
C              -2  take the next step with a new value of H,
C                    but with other inputs unchanged.
C          On return, JSTART is set to 1 to facilitate continuation.
C KFLAG  = a completion code with the following meanings:
C               0  the step was succesful.
C              -1  the requested error could not be achieved.
C              -2  corrector convergence could not be achieved.
C              -3  fatal error in DSETPK or DSOLPK.
C          A return with KFLAG = -1 or -2 means either
C          ABS(H) = HMIN or 10 consecutive failures occurred.
C          On a return with KFLAG negative, the values of TN and
C          the YH array are as of the beginning of the last
C          step, and H is the last step size attempted.
C MAXORD = the maximum order of integration method to be allowed.
C MAXCOR = the maximum number of corrector iterations allowed.
C MSBP   = maximum number of steps between DSETPK calls (MITER .gt. 0).
C MXNCF  = maximum number of convergence failures allowed.
C METH/MITER = the method flags.  See description in driver.
C N      = the number of first-order differential equations.

C DSTODI performs one step of the integration of an initial value
C problem for a system of Ordinary Differential Equations.
C Note: DSTODI is independent of the value of the iteration method
C indicator MITER, and hence is independent
C of the type of chord method used, or the Jacobian structure.
C Communication with DSTODI is done with the following variables:
C
C NEQ    = integer array containing problem size in NEQ(1), and
C          passed as the NEQ argument in all calls to RES, ADDA,
C          and JAC.
C Y      = an array of length .ge. N used as the Y argument in
C          all calls to RES, JAC, and ADDA.
C NEQ    = integer array containing problem size in NEQ(1), and
C          passed as the NEQ argument in all calls tO RES, G, ADDA,
C          and JAC.
C YH     = an NYH by LMAX array containing the dependent variables
C          and their approximate scaled derivatives, where
C          LMAX = MAXORD + 1.  YH(i,j+1) contains the approximate
C          j-th derivative of y(i), scaled by H**j/factorial(j)
C          (j = 0,1,...,NQ).  On entry for the first step, the first
C          two columns of YH must be set from the initial values.
C NYH    = a constant integer .ge. N, the first dimension of YH.
C YH1    = a one-dimensional array occupying the same space as YH.
C EWT    = an array of length N containing multiplicative weights
C          for local error measurements.  Local errors in y(i) are
C          compared to 1.0/EWT(i) in various error tests.
C SAVF   = an array of working storage, of length N. also used for
C          input of YH(*,MAXORD+2) when JSTART = -1 and MAXORD is less
C          than the current order NQ.
C          Same as YDOTI in the driver.
C SAVR   = an array of working storage, of length N.
C ACOR   = a work array of length N used for the accumulated
C          corrections. On a succesful return, ACOR(i) contains
C          the estimated one-step local error in y(i).
C WM,IWM = real and integer work arrays associated with matrix
C          operations in chord iteration.
C PJAC   = name of routine to evaluate and preprocess Jacobian matrix.
C SLVS   = name of routine to solve linear system in chord iteration.
C CCMAX  = maximum relative change in H*EL0 before PJAC is called.
C H      = the step size to be attempted on the next step.
C          H is altered by the error control algorithm during the
C          problem.  H can be either positive or negative, but its
C          sign must remain constant throughout the problem.
C HMIN   = the minimum absolute value of the step size H to be used.
C HMXI   = inverse of the maximum absolute value of H to be used.
C          HMXI = 0.0 is allowed and corresponds to an infinite HMAX.
C          HMIN and HMXI may be changed at any time, but will not
C          take effect until the next change of H is considered.
C TN     = the independent variable. TN is updated on each step taken.
C JSTART = an integer used for input only, with the following
C          values and meanings:
C               0  perform the first step.
C           .gt.0  take a new step continuing from the last.
C              -1  take the next step with a new value of H, MAXORD,
C                    N, METH, MITER, and/or matrix parameters.
C              -2  take the next step with a new value of H,
C                    but with other inputs unchanged.
C          On return, JSTART is set to 1 to facilitate continuation.
C KFLAG  = a completion code with the following meanings:
C               0  the step was succesful.
C              -1  the requested error could not be achieved.
C              -2  corrector convergence could not be achieved.
C              -3  RES ordered immediate return.
C              -4  error condition from RES could not be avoided.
C              -5  fatal error in PJAC or SLVS.
C          A return with KFLAG = -1, -2, or -4 means either
C          ABS(H) = HMIN or 10 consecutive failures occurred.
C          On a return with KFLAG negative, the values of TN and
C          the YH array are as of the beginning of the last
C          step, and H is the last step size attempted.
C MAXORD = the maximum order of integration method to be allowed.
C MAXCOR = the maximum number of corrector iterations allowed.
C MSBP   = maximum number of steps between PJAC calls.
C MXNCF  = maximum number of convergence failures allowed.
C METH/MITER = the method flags.  See description in driver.
C N      = the number of first-order differential equations.

C occurs (in corrector convergence or error test), RMAX is set at 2

C DPREPJI is called by DSTODI to compute and process the matrix
C P = A - H*EL(1)*J , where J is an approximation to the Jacobian dr/dy,
C where r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*s.  Here J is computed by the user-supplied
C routine JAC if MITER = 1 or 4, or by finite differencing if MITER =
C 2 or 5.  J is stored in WM, rescaled, and ADDA is called to generate
C P. P is then subjected to LU decomposition in preparation
C for later solution of linear systems with P as coefficient
C matrix.  This is done by DGEFA if MITER = 1 or 2, and by
C DGBFA if MITER = 4 or 5.
C
C In addition to variables described previously, communication
C with DPREPJI uses the following:
C Y     = array containing predicted values on entry.
C RTEM  = work array of length N (ACOR in DSTODI).
C SAVR  = array used for output only.  On output it contains the
C         residual evaluated at current values of t and y.
C S     = array containing predicted values of dy/dt (SAVF in DSTODI).
C WM    = real work space for matrices.  On output it contains the
C         LU decomposition of P.
C         Storage of matrix elements starts at WM(3).
C         WM also contains the following matrix-related data:
C         WM(1) = SQRT(UROUND), used in numerical Jacobian increments.
C IWM   = integer work space containing pivot information, starting at
C         IWM(21).  IWM also contains the band parameters
C         ML = IWM(1) and MU = IWM(2) if MITER is 4 or 5.
C EL0   = el(1) (input).
C IERPJ = output error flag.
C         = 0 if no trouble occurred,
C         = 1 if the P matrix was found to be singular,
C         = IRES (= 2 or 3) if RES returned IRES = 2 or 3.
C JCUR  = output flag = 1 to indicate that the Jacobian matrix
C         (or approximation) is now current.
C This routine also uses the Common variables EL0, H, TN, UROUND,

C             Solution of Block-Tridiagonal Systems of Linear
C             Algebraic Equations
C             A.C. Hindmarsh
C             February 1977
C The input matrix contains three blocks of elements in each block-row,
C including blocks in the (1,3) and (N,N-2) block positions.
C DDECBT uses block Gauss elimination and Subroutines DGEFA and DGESL
C for solution of blocks.  Partial pivoting is done within
C block-rows only.
C
C Note: this version uses LINPACK routines DGEFA/DGESL instead of
C of dec/sol for solution of blocks, and it uses the BLAS routine DDOT
C for dot product calculations.
C
C Input:
C     M = order of each block.
C     N = number of blocks in each direction of the matrix.
C         N must be 4 or more.  The complete matrix has order M*N.
C     A = M by M by N array containing diagonal blocks.
C         A(i,j,k) contains the (i,j) element of the k-th block.
C     B = M by M by N array containing the super-diagonal blocks
C         (in B(*,*,k) for k = 1,...,N-1) and the block in the (N,N-2)
C         block position (in B(*,*,N)).
C     C = M by M by N array containing the subdiagonal blocks
C         (in C(*,*,k) for k = 2,3,...,N) and the block in the
C         (1,3) block position (in C(*,*,1)).
C    IP = integer array of length M*N for working storage.
C Output:
C A,B,C = M by M by N arrays containing the block-LU decomposition
C         of the input matrix.
C    IP = M by N array of pivot information.  IP(*,k) contains
C         information for the k-th digonal block.
C   IER = 0  if no trouble occurred, or
C       = -1 if the input value of M or N was illegal, or
C       = k  if a singular matrix was found in the k-th diagonal block.
C Use DSOLBT to solve the associated linear system.
C
C External routines required: DGEFA and DGESL (from LINPACK) and
C DDOT (from the BLAS, or Basic Linear Algebra package).

C This routine performs preprocessing related to the sparse linear
C systems that must be solved.
C The operations that are performed here are:
C  * compute sparseness structure of the iteration matrix
C      P = A - con*J  according to MOSS,
C  * compute grouping of column indices (MITER = 2),
C  * compute a new ordering of rows and columns of the matrix,
C  * reorder JA corresponding to the new ordering,
C  * perform a symbolic LU factorization of the matrix, and
C  * set pointers for segments of the IWK/WK array.
C In addition to variables described previously, DPREPI uses the
C following for communication:
C YH     = the history array.  Only the first column, containing the
C          current Y vector, is used.  Used only if MOSS .ne. 0.
C S      = array of length NEQ, identical to YDOTI in the driver, used
C          only if MOSS .ne. 0.
C SAVR   = a work array of length NEQ, used only if MOSS .ne. 0.
C EWT    = array of length NEQ containing (inverted) error weights.
C          Used only if MOSS = 2 or 4 or if ISTATE = MOSS = 1.
C RTEM   = a work array of length NEQ, identical to ACOR in the driver,
C          used only if MOSS = 2 or 4.
C WK     = a real work array of length LENWK, identical to WM in
C          the driver.
C IWK    = integer work array, assumed to occupy the same space as WK.
C LENWK  = the length of the work arrays WK and IWK.
C ISTATC = a copy of the driver input argument ISTATE (= 1 on the

C IYS    = flag value from ODRV or CDRV.
C IPPER  = output error flag , with the following values and meanings:
C        =   0  no error.
C        =  -1  insufficient storage for internal structure pointers.
C        =  -2  insufficient storage for JGROUP.

C P and its LU decomposition are stored separately in WK.

C RTEM  = work array of length N (ACOR in DSTODI).
C SAVR  = array containing r evaluated at predicted y. On output it

C         starts at WK(3).
C         WK also contains the following matrix-related data.
C         WK(1) = SQRT(UROUND), used in numerical Jacobian increments.
C IWK   = integer work space for matrix-related data, assumed to be
C         equivalenced to WK.  In addition,  WK(IPRSP) and IWK(IPISP)
C         are assumed to have identical locations.
C EL0   = EL(1) (input).

C                which were used to obtain it.
C                The factorization can be written  A = L*U  where
C                L  is a product of permutation and unit lower
C                triangular matrices and  U  is upper triangular.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     DGBSL solves the double precision band system
C     A * X = B  or  TRANS(A) * X = B
C     using the factors computed by DGBCO or DGBFA.
C
C     On Entry
C
C        ABD     DOUBLE PRECISION(LDA, N)
C                the output from DGBCO or DGBFA.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                the leading dimension of the array  ABD .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                the order of the original matrix.
C
C        ML      INTEGER
C                number of diagonals below the main diagonal.
C
C        MU      INTEGER
C                number of diagonals above the main diagonal.
C
C        IPVT    INTEGER(N)
C                the pivot vector from DGBCO or DGBFA.
C
C        B       DOUBLE PRECISION(N)
C                the right hand side vector.
C
C        JOB     INTEGER
C                = 0         to solve  A*X = B ,
C                = nonzero   to solve  TRANS(A)*X = B , where
C                            TRANS(A)  is the transpose.
C
C     On Return
C
C        B       the solution vector  X .
C
C     Error Condition
C
C        A division by zero will occur if the input factor contains a
C        zero on the diagonal.  Technically this indicates singularity
C        but it is often caused by improper arguments or improper
C        setting of LDA .  It will not occur if the subroutines are
C        called correctly and if DGBCO has set RCOND .GT. 0.0
C        or DGBFA has set INFO .EQ. 0 .
C
C     To compute  INVERSE(A) * C  where  C  is a matrix
C     with  P  columns
C           CALL DGBCO(ABD,LDA,N,ML,MU,IPVT,RCOND,Z)
C           IF (RCOND is too small) GO TO ...
C           DO 10 J = 1, P

      SUBROUTINE XERRWD (MSG, NMES, NERR, LEVEL, NI, I1, I2, NR, R1, R2)
C***BEGIN PROLOGUE  XERRWD
C***SUBSIDIARY
C***PURPOSE  Write error message with values.
C***CATEGORY  R3C
C***TYPE      DOUBLE PRECISION (XERRWV-S, XERRWD-D)
C***AUTHOR  Hindmarsh, Alan C., (LLNL)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  Subroutines XERRWD, XSETF, XSETUN, and the function routine IXSAV,
C  as given here, constitute a simplified version of the SLATEC error
C  handling package.
C
C  All arguments are input arguments.
C
C  MSG    = The message (character array).
C  NMES   = The length of MSG (number of characters).
C  NERR   = The error number (not used).
C  LEVEL  = The error level..
C           0 or 1 means recoverable (control returns to caller).
C           2 means fatal (run is aborted--see note below).
C  NI     = Number of integers (0, 1, or 2) to be printed with message.
C  I1,I2  = Integers to be printed, depending on NI.
C  NR     = Number of reals (0, 1, or 2) to be printed with message.
C  R1,R2  = Reals to be printed, depending on NR.
C
C  Note..  this routine is machine-dependent and specialized for use
C  in limited context, in the following ways..
C  1. The argument MSG is assumed to be of type CHARACTER, and
C     the message is printed with a format of (1X,A).
C  2. The message is assumed to take only one line.
C     Multi-line messages are generated by repeated calls.
C  3. If LEVEL = 2, control passes to the statement   STOP
C     to abort the run.  This statement may be machine-dependent.
C  4. R1 and R2 are assumed to be in double precision and are printed
C     in D21.13 format.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  IXSAV saves and recalls one of two error message parameters:
C    LUNIT, the logical unit number to which messages are printed, and
C    MESFLG, the message print flag.
C  This is a modification of the SLATEC library routine J4SAVE.
C
C  Saved local variables..
C   LUNIT  = Logical unit number for messages.  The default is obtained
C            by a call to IUMACH (may be machine-dependent).
C   MESFLG = Print control flag..
C            1 means print all messages (the default).
C            0 means no printing.
C
C  On input..
C    IPAR   = Parameter indicator (1 for LUNIT, 2 for MESFLG).
C    IVALUE = The value to be set for the parameter, if ISET = .TRUE.
C    ISET   = Logical flag to indicate whether to read or write.
C             If ISET = .TRUE., the parameter will be given
C             the value IVALUE.  If ISET = .FALSE., the parameter
C             will be unchanged, and IVALUE is a dummy argument.
